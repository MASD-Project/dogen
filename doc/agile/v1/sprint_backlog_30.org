# Introduction

And so t'was that the 29th sprint of the 1.0 era finally came to a close; and what a bumper sprint it was. If you recall, on [Sprint 28](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/releases/tag/v1.0.28) we saw the light and embarked on a coding walkabout to do a "bridge refactor". The rough objective was to complete a number of half-baked refactors, and normalise the entire architecture around key domain concepts that have been absorbed from MDE (Model Driven Engineering) literature. Sprint 29 brings this large wandering to a close - well, at least as much as one can "close" these sort of _never ending things_ - and leaves us on a great position to focus back on "real work". Lest you have forgotten, the "real work" had been to wrap things up with the PMM (Physical Meta-Model), but it had fallen by the wayside since the end of [Sprint 27](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/releases/tag/v1.0.27). When this work resumes, we can now reason about the architecture without having to imagine some idealised target state that would probably never arrive (at the rate we were progressing), making the effort a lot less onerous. Alas, this trivialises the sprint somewhat. The truth was that it took over 380 commits and 89 hours of intense effort to get us in this place, and it is difficult to put in words the insane amount of work that makes up this release. Nevertheless, one is compeled to give it a good old go, so settle in for the ride that was Sprint 29.

# User visible changes

This section normally covers stories that affect end users, with the video providing a quick demonstration of the new features, and the sections below describing them in more detail. As there were no user facing features, the video discusses the work on internal features instead.

# Development Matters

In this section we cover topics that are mainly of interest if you follow Dogen development, such as details on internal stories that consumed significant resources, important events, etc. As usual, for all the gory details of the work carried out this sprint, see [the sprint log](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/v1/sprint_backlog_29.org).

## Significant Internal Stories

This sprint had two key goals, both of which were achieved:

- moving remaining "formattable" types to logical and physical models.
- Merge ```text``` models.

By far, the bulk of the work went on the second of these two goals. In addition, a "stretch" goal appeared towards the end of the sprint, which was to tidy-up and merge the ```codec``` model. These goals were implemented by means of four core stories, which captured four different aspects of the work, and were then aided by a cast of smaller stories which, in truth, were more like sub-stories of these "conceptual epics". We shall cover the main stories in the next sections and slot in the smaller stories as required. Finally, there were a number of small "straggler stories" which we'll cover at the end.

### Complete the formattables refactor

A very long running saga - nay, a veritable Brazilian soap opera of coding - finally came to an end this sprint with the conclusion of the "formattables" refactor. We shan't repeat ourselves explaining what this work entailed, given that [previous release notes](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/releases/tag/v1.0.28) had already done so in excruciating detail, but its certainly worth perusing those writings to get an understanding of the pain involved. This sprint we merely had to tie up lose ends and handle the C# aspects of the formattables namespace. As before, all of these objects were moved to "suitable" locations within the LPS (Logical-Physical Space), though perhaps further rounds of modeling clean-ups are required to address the many shortcomings of the "lift-and-shift" approach taken. This was by design, mind you; it would have been very tricky, and _extremely_ slow-going, if we had to do a proper domain analysis for each of these concepts and then determine the correct way of modeling them. Instead, we continued the approach laid out for the C++ model, which was to move these crazy critters to the ```logical``` or ```physical``` models with the least possible amount of extra work. To be fair, the end result was not completely offensive to our sense of taste, in _most_ cases, but there were indeed instances that required closing one's eyes and "just get on with it", for we kept on being tempted to do things "properly". It takes a Buddhist-monk-like discipline to restrict oneself to a single "kind" of refactor at a time, but it is crucial to do so because otherwise one will be forever stuck in the "refactor loop", which we described in [The Refactoring Quagmire](https://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/2018/01/nerd-food-refactoring-quagmire.html) all those moons ago.

It is also perhaps worth spending a few moments to reflect on the lessons taught by formattables. On one hand, it is a clear validation of the empirical approach. After all, though the modeling was completely wrong from a domain expertise standpoint, much of what was laid out within this namespace captured the essence of the task at hand. So, what was _wrong_ about formattables? The key problem was that we believed that there were three representations necessary for code-generation:

- the external representation, which is now housed in the ```codec``` model;
- the "language agnostic" representation, which is now housed in the ```logic``` model;
- the "language-specific" representation, which was implemented by formattables (_i.e._, ```text.cpp``` and ```text.csharp```).

What the empirical approach demonstrated was that there is no clear way to separate the second and third representations, try as we might, because there is just _so much_ overlap between them. The road to the LPS had necessarily to go through formattables, because _in theory_ it appeared so clear and logical that separate TSs (Technical Spaces) should have clean, TS-specific representations which were ready to be written to files. As [Mencken stated](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2016/07/17/solution/):

> Every complex problem has a solution which is simple, direct, plausible—and wrong.

In fact, It took a great deal of careful reading through the literature, together with a lot of practical experimentation, to realise that doing so is not at all  practical. Thus, it does not seem that it was possible to have avoided making this design mistake. One could even say that this "mistake" is nothing but the empirical approach at play, because you are expected to conduct experiments and accumulate facts about your object of study, and then revise your hypothesis accordingly. The downside, of course, is that it takes a fair amount of time and effort to perform these "revisions" and it certainly feels as if there was "wasted time" which could have been saved if only we started off with the correct design in the first place. Alas, it is not clear how would one simply have the intuition for the correct design _without_ the experimentation. In other words, the programmer's perennial condition.

### Move helpers into ```text``` model and add them to the PMM

As described in the story above, it has become increasingly clear that the ```text``` model is nothing but a repository of M2T (Model to Text) transforms, spread out across TS's and exposed programatically into the PMM for code generation purposes. Therefore, the TS-specific models for C++ and C# no longer make any sense; what is instead required is a combined ```text``` model containing all of the text transforms, adequately namespaced, making use of common interfaces and instantiating all of the appropriate PMM entities. This "merging" work fell under the umbrella of the architectural clean up work planned for this sprint.

The first shot across the bow in the merging war concerned moving "helpers" from both C++ and C# models into the combined model. A bit of historical context is perhaps useful here. Helpers, in the M2T sense, have been a pet-peeve of ours for many _many_ moons. Their role is to code-generate _functionlets_ inside of the archetypes (_e.g._ the "real" M2T transforms). These helpers, via an _awfully_ complicated binding logic which we shall not bore you with, bind to the type system and then end up acting as "mini-adapters" for specific purposes, such as allowing us to use third-party libraries within Dogen, cleaning up strings prior to dumping them in streams and so forth. A code sample should help in clarifying this notion. The below code fragment, taken from ```logical::entities::element```, contains the output three different helper functions:

```c++
inline std::string tidy_up_string(std::string s) {
    boost::replace_all(s, "\r\n", "<new_line>");
    boost::replace_all(s, "\n", "<new_line>");
    boost::replace_all(s, "\"", "<quote>");
    boost::replace_all(s, "\\", "<backslash>");
    return s;
}

namespace boost {

inline bool operator==(const boost::shared_ptr<dogen::variability::entities::configuration>& lhs,
const boost::shared_ptr<dogen::variability::entities::configuration>& rhs) {
    return (!lhs && !rhs) ||(lhs && rhs && (*lhs == *rhs));
}

}

namespace boost {

inline std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& s, const boost::shared_ptr<dogen::variability::entities::configuration>& v) {
    s << "{ " << "\"__type__\": " << "\"boost::shared_ptr\"" << ", "
      << "\"memory\": " << "\"" << static_cast<void*>(v.get()) << "\"" << ", ";

    if (v)
        s << "\"data\": " << *v;
    else
        s << "\"data\": ""\"<null>\"";
    s << " }";
    return s;
}

}
```

The main advantage of the "helper approach" is that one does not have to distribute any additional header files or libraries to compile the generated code, other than the third-party libraries themselves. Sadly, this is not sufficient to compensate for its downsides. This approach has never been particularly efficient or _pretty_ - imagine hundreds of lines such as the above scattered around the code base - but, significantly, it isn't particularly scalable _either_, because one needs to modify the code generator accordingly for every new third party library, together with the associated (and rather complex) bindings. Our incursions through the literature provided a much cleaner way to address these requirements via hand-crafted PDMs (Platform Definition Models), which are coupled with third-party libraries and are responsible for providing any glue needed by generated code. However, since we've been knee-deep into a cascade of refactoring efforts, we could not bring ourselves to halt the present work once more and context-switch to yet another (possibly) long running refactoring effort. As a result, we decided to keep calm and carry on the burden of moving helpers around, until such time we could refactor them out of existence. The ```text``` model merging did present a chance to revisit this decision, but we thought best "to confuse one issue at a time" and decided to "just move" the helpers across to the ```text``` model. As it turned out, "just moving" them was no trivial matter. Our troubles begun as soon as we tried to untangle the "helpers" from the "assistant".

At this juncture, your design alarm bells are probably ringing very loudly, and so were ours. After all, a common adage amongst senior developers is that whenever you come up with entities named "assistant", "helper", "manager" and the like, they are giving you a clear and unambiguous indication that you have a slim understanding of the domain; worse, they'll soon devolve into a great big ball of mud, for no one can possibly divine their responsibilities. The blog posts on this matter are far too many to count - _i.e._, [Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/i-shall-call-it-somethingmanager), [Alan Green](http://www.bright-green.com/blog/2003_02_25/naming_java_classes_without_a.html), and many Stack Overflow posts such as [this one](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/129537/can-manager-classes-be-a-sign-of-bad-architecture). However, after some investigation, it seemed there was indeed some method in our madness:

- the "helpers" where really PDMs in disguise, and those would be dealt with at some point in the future, so they could be ignored for now;
- the "assistant" had ultimately two distinct responsibilities: 1) to perform some TS-specific transformation of data elements from the logical model, which we now understood to fall under the logical model umbrella; 2) to perform some "formating assistance", providing common routines to a lot of M2T transforms. We implemented some of these refactors, but others were deemed to be outside of the scope of the present exercise, and were therefore added to the backlog.

This was the harbinger of things to come. Much more significantly, assistants and helpers where bound together in a cycle, meaning we could not move them incrementally to the ```text``` model as we originally envisioned. As we've elaborated many a times in these pages, cycles are never the bearers of good fortune, so we took upon ourselves breaking the cycle as part of this exercise. Fortunately this was not too difficult, as the parts of the assistant API used by the helpers were fairly self contained. The functionality was encapsulated into an ABC (Abstract Base Class), a decision that is not without controversy, but which suffices amply to address the problem at hand - all the more so given that helpers are to be removed in the not too distant future.

A third stumbling block was that, even though helpers are deprecated and their impact should be contained to legacy code, they still needed to be accessible via the PMM. Sadly, the existing helper code was making use of some of the same features which in the new world are addressed by the PMM, and so we had no choice but to extend the PMM with helper support. Though not ideal, this was done in a fairly painless manner, and it is hopefully self-contained enough that not much of the code base will start to rely on its presence. Once all of these obstacles were resolved, the bulk of the work was fairly repetitive: to move helpers in groups into the ```text``` model, tidying up each text template until it produced compilable code.

In the end, the following stories were required to bring the main story to a close:

- **Improvements to template processing in logical model**: minor fixes to how templates were being handled.
- **Convert legacy helpers into new style helpers in C++**: the bulk of the adaptation work in the C++ TS.
- **Add C++ helpers to the PMM**: Adding PMM infrastructure to deal with helpers. Here we are mainly concerned with C++, but to be fair much of the infrastructure is common to all TSs.
- **Remove unused wale keys in ```text.cpp```**: minor tidy-up of templates and associated wale (mustache) keys.
- **Merge ```cpp_artefact_transform*``` wale templates** : Removal of unnecessary wale (mustache) templates.
- **Add C# helpers to the PMM**: Modifications to the PMM to cater for C#-specific concerns.
- **Move helpers to ```text``` model**: Remaining work in moving the helpers across to the combined ```text``` model.

### Move text transforms in C++ and C# models into text model

Once we had helpers under our belt, we could turn our attention to the more pressing concerns of the M2T transforms. These presented a bigger problem due to scale: there are just _far too many_ text transforms. This was a particularly annoying problem due to how editing in Dia works at present, with severe limitations on copying and pasting across diagrams. Alas, there was nothing for it but patience. Over a long period of time, we performed a similar exercise to that of the helpers and moved each text template into their resting location in the ```text``` model. The work was not what you'd call a creative exercise, but nonetheless an important one because the final layout of the ```text``` model now mirrors the contents of the PMM - precisely what we had intended from the beginning.

_Figure 1: Birds-eye view of the ```text``` model_

Figure 1 shows a birds-eye view of the ```text``` model. On the top-leftmost corner, in orange, you can see the wale (mustache) templates. Next to it is the ```entities``` namespace, containing the definition of the LPS (in pink-ish). At the bottom of the picture, with the greener tones, you have the two major TS: C++ (on the bottom left) and C# (on the bottom right, clipped). Each TS shows some of the M2T transforms that composes them. All elements are exposed into the PMM via code-generation.

### Clean up and merge codec models

The final "large" architectural problem we had to address was the current approach for the ```codec``` models. Long ago, we envisioned a proliferation of the number of codecs for Dogen, and so thought these should be dynamically injected to facilitate the use case. In our view, each codec would extend Dogen to process file types for specific uses, such as adding eCore support, as well as for other, non-UML-based representations. Whilst we still see a need for such an approach, it was originally done with little conceptual understanding of MDE and as such resulted in lots of _suis generis_ terminology. In addition, we ended up with lots of little "modelets" with tiny bits of functionality, because each codec now shares most of its pipeline with the main ```codec``` model. Thus, the right approach was to merge all of these models into the ```codec``` model, and to move away from legacy terms such as ```hydrator```, ```encoder``` and the like, favouring instead the typical MDE terminology of transforms and transform chains. This story covered the bulk of the work, including the merging of the ```codec.json``` and ```codec.org``` models, but sadly just as we were closing in in the ```codec.dia``` model we ran out of time. The work shall be completed early next sprint.

![Codec model](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/raw/master/doc/blog/images/dogen_codec_model_transforms.png)
_Figure 2: Fragment of the ```codec``` model after refactoring._

Other stories related to this work:

- **Use MDE terminology in Dia model**: the plain (non-codec) representation of Dia got an "MDE tidy-up, following the same pattern as all other models and using transforms rather than hydrators, etc.

### Assorted smaller stories

A number of small stories was also worked on:

- **Fix some problems with c++ visual studio**: assorted improvements to Visual Studio project files; though these are still not ready for end users.
- **Orchestration should have an initialiser**: instead of copying and pasting the individual initialisers, create a top-level initialiser in orchestration and reuse it.
- **Add namespaces to "dummy function"**: two classes with the same name in different namespaces resulted in the same "dummy" function, resulting in spurious OSX warnings. With this change, we generate the dummy function name from file path resulting in unique names in a component.
- **Remove disabled files from project items**: C# and C++ Visual Studio solutions contained files for disabled facets, due to the way enablement worked in C#. With the merge to the text model, this caused problems so we now honour disabled facets when generating project files.
- **Remove JSON models from Dogen**: Remove tests for JSON models within the Dogen product. JSON is still supported within the C++ reference implementation, but at least this way we do not need to regenerate the JSON models every time we change Dogen models which is quite often.

## Resourcing

On one hand, the utilisation rate of 35% was not particularly brilliant this sprint, but by pretty much any other metric it has to be considered a model of resource consumption (if you pardon the MDE pun). Almost 89% of the total ask was used on stories directly related to the development process, and whilst the break down of stories was not exactly stellar, we still managed a good spread with the top 3 stories consuming 24.1%, 17.8% and 15.2% respectively. We tend to look closely at this because its a good indicator of the health of the analysis of a sprint, and its always a bad sign when one story dominates the majority of the ask. Nonetheless, when one looks at the story titles in more detail its still clear that there was a certain element of laziness in how the work was split and, as always, there is room for improvement in this department. The 11% on non-core tasks had the usual characteristics, with 5.7% allocated to the release notes, and a very cheap demo at 0.5%. One important note though is that this sprint consumed almost 90 hours in total rather than the more traditional 80, which means that looking at percentage numbers is somewhat misleading, particularly when comparing to a typical sprint. The major downside of this sprint was general tiredness, as usual, given the huge amount of the commitment. Sadly not much can be changed in this department, and ideally we wouldn't want to slow down in the next sprint though the Holidays may have a detrimental effect.

## Roadmap

The key alteration to the road map - other than the removal of the long standing "formattables refactor" - was the addition of the org-mode codec. We've spent far too many hours dealing with the inadequacies of Dia, and it is by now clear that we have much to gain by moving into Emacs for all our modeling needs (and thus, all our Dogen needs since everything else is already done inside Emacs). Therefore we've decided to take the hit and work on implementing org-mode support next sprint before we resume the PMM work. Other than that we are as we were, though on the plus side the road map does have a very realistic feel now given that we are actually completing targets on a sprint by sprint basis.

# Binaries

You can download binaries from either [Bintray](https://bintray.com/masd-project/main/dogen/1.0.29) or [GitHub](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/releases/tag/v1.0.29), as per Table 3. All binaries are 64-bit. For all other architectures and/or operative systems, you will need to build Dogen from source. Source downloads are available in [zip](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/archive/v1.0.28.zip) or [tar.gz](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/archive/v1.0.29.tar.gz) format.

_Table 3: Binary packages for Dogen._

**Note 1:** The OSX and Linux binaries are not stripped at present and so are larger than they should be. We have [an outstanding story](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/product_backlog.org#linux-and-osx-binaries-are-not-stripped) to address this issue, but sadly CMake does not make this a trivial undertaking.

**Note 2:** Due to issues with Travis CI, we had a number of failed OSX builds and we could not produce a final build for this sprint. However, given no user related functionality is provided, we left the link to the last successful build of Sprint 29. The situation with Travis CI is rather uncertain at present so we may remove support for OSX builds altogether next sprint.

# Next Sprint

The goals for the next sprint are:

- to finish the codec tidy-up work.
- to implement org mode codec.
- to start implement path and dependencies via PMM.

That's all for this release. Happy Modeling!

*** COMPLETED Stitch formatter updates                                :story:
    CLOSED: [2020-12-18 Fri 09:05]

There are a number of issues with stitch formatters at present:

- stitch transform is still generating its own artefact.

Actually, now that we've updated all formatters do we even need a
stitch formatter? The helpers are probably going via some other
route. If so, remove it and the wale formatter.

This is incorrect. Whilst we are using the output of stitch in a
different way, we are still expanding the stitch template for the
header files.

*** COMPLETED Clean up helpers interface and move it to =text=        :story:
    CLOSED: [2020-12-18 Fri 09:05]

Notes:

- we need to include the wale template in the meta-model
  element. Once this is done we should see if we can remove the stitch
  and wale formatters in the c++ model.
- the helper interface should only take logical and physical types so
  that we can move it to =text=. However, we may be using the
  assistant. See if we can create the assistant inside the helper as
  we do with formatters.

*** COMPLETED Create a "combined" assistant in =text=                 :story:
    CLOSED: [2020-12-18 Fri 09:06]

*Rationale*: implemented in the previous sprint.

Assistant should not really exist, but to get us to the next step we
should just make it a helper in =text= model. We just need to merge
the C++ and C# classes into one and move it to =text=.

Create an org-mode model, and add transforms to read from
org-mode. The remaining work should go under their own stories (codec,
writing support, etc).

Merged stories:

*Org-mode as a carrier format for modeling*

This is a bit of a weird idea, but may just work; this story is a
placeholder to capture ideas in this space. Consider a org-mode
file as a model. Ideas:

- the top-level properties are all model properties. For example, if
  you add text at the top, that is a model comment.
- We could add a org-mode file link for each file element so that we
  could easily move from model to implementation. The file format
  should have a section for this (files by facet?), with all of the
  bookmarks. However, its a bit painful to do this manually, so we
  need some form of round-tripping.
- we can also make use of the exact same format for Dogen comments as
  we do in Dia, with =#DOGEN= markers.
- stereotypes and other meta-data can be conveyed using org-mode
  properties. In addition, due to org-babel, we can include code
  snippets on any programming language, with some (minimal) IDE-like
  integration.
- we could also include the GUIDs for merging as org-mode properties.
- once we create a C++ stand-alone product to represent org-mode
  documents, we can just create an adapter for it as an injector.
- there already is some support for creating state-machines in
  org-mode: [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-dot-diagrams.html][Org tutorial on generating simple process diagrams using
  dot and tables]]
- we should also look at verb as an extension to org-mode.
- to parse drawers, we should add two methods to the parser:

  1. try parse drawer start
  2. try parse drawer content

  we can detect the end of the drawer manually by looking for =:END:=.

*** COMPLETED Remove leading and trailing new lines from comments     :story:

    :END:

At present we are using the comments as supplied in the codec
model. This works ok mostly, but it has some issues. For Dia the main
issue is when we use meta-data in a comment, e.g.:

: Directory in which to place C++ source files.
:
: #DOGEN masd.variability.binding_point=global

We don't really want a trailing line in this comment, but we need it
to separate the meta-data. The end result is not ideal:

:     r.name().simple("source_directory_name");
:     r.name().qualified("masd.cpp.source_directory_name");
:     r.description(R"(Directory in which to place C++ source files.
:
: )");

Similarly in org-mode we are removing the spaces to avoid spurious
diffs:

: :masd.codec.reference: masd.variability
: :masd.codec.reference: dogen.profiles
: :masd.variability.profile: dogen.profiles.base.default_profile
: :END:
: Implements the command-line interface for Dogen.

: :PROPERTIES:
: :masd.codec.stereotypes: masd::exception
: :END:

One possible solution is to always remove leading and trailing new
lines, as a transform inside the logical model.

We have whitespace between wale and stitch template, like so:

: <#$ stitch.wale.template_instantiation_result #>
: <#+
:
: void smart_pointer_helper_transform::
: apply(std::ostream& os, const logical::entities::model& /*m*/,
:

However, the generated code does not contain the whitespace:

:     const logical::entities::helper_properties& /*hp*/) const {
:     return true;
: }
: void smart_pointer_helper_transform::apply(std::ostream& os, const logical::entities::model& m,

We seem to be trimming the block somehow. Actually the problem is that
with the trimming of whitespace on the documentation transform we
removed the trailing new line. That means that the space on the stitch
template is actually now being used to new line the wale template. We
did a quick hack to address this problem by adding the newline when
rendering the wale template. This is not great but it solves the
problem at hand.

- =physical.transforms.merge_transform=: set to chain by mistake?
- we are now generating both C++ and C# code. This implies something
  is not quite right with the profile binding. However a cursory
  inspection of profiles shows that they seemed to have been
  transformed correctly. The problem may be more suitable, causing
  some binding error. We need to check that the model is binding to
  the base profile. It is not clear if this is the root cause:

We should normalise all models into org-mode. We need to convert the
library models into org, and deal with any missing information we may
have from the JSON front end.

Notes:

- Error with enums:

: 2020-12-26 20:52:38.570793 [DEBUG] [logical.transforms.enumerations_transform] Started transform: enumerations
: 2020-12-26 20:52:38.570801 [DEBUG] [logical.transforms.enumerations_transform] Obtaining default enumeration underlying element name for model: dogen.text
: 2020-12-26 20:52:38.570806 [ERROR] [logical.transforms.enumerations_transform] Model does not have a default enumeration type: dogen.text

  The problem is probably coming from some JSON special code:

#+begin_src json
{
      "name": "int8_t",
      "stereotypes": [
        "masd::builtin"
      ],
      "can_be_enumeration_underlier": true,
      "can_be_primitive_underlier": true,
      "tagged_values": {
#+end_src

- =can_be_enumeration_underlier= and =can_be_primitive_underlier= are
  probably being lost in translation.
- for some reason some types are not coming through correctly:

: std::exception::what: Invalid underlying type: std.string

  Nothing looks incorrect in the =std::string= org
  representation. This was due to bugs in meta-data processing.
- JSON models are encoding namespaces in names:

:       "name": "posix_time::ptime",

  We need to detect qualified names and then add the required
  headlines. Actually this is very tricky: at present we do not have a
  proper way to convert the JSON models into a structure with
  containment without going into the logical model. It would be a fair
  bit of work to port this into codec. Instead, we can just convert
  the models that require this manually.

We need to convert all reference models into org, and add tests for
them.

Notes:

- empty packages are interpreted as elements. There is no easy way to
  know what is what, other than creating the notion of packages in the
  codec model. We need to read the fallback type and use it to
  populate a new tag for modules.

*Rationale*: implemented as part of the org codec work.

Seems like a better name is needed for this model. Perhaps =orgmode=?
Or just =org=? Just don't like =org_mode=.

*** COMPLETED Analysis on org-mode outstanding work                   :story:
    CLOSED: [2020-12-28 Mon 09:27]

*Rationale*: implemented as separate stories.

Notes:

- map dogen types to a org-mode tag. The tags must replace =::= with
  an underscore, e.g. =masd_enumeration= for
  =masd::enumeration=. Mapping is done by detecting stereotype in the
  stereotype list and removing it from there. Non-tagged headlines
  default to documentation (see below).
- any non-tagged section will be treated as documentation. On
  generation it will be suitably converted into the language's format
  for documentation (e.g. doxygen, C# docs etc). We need meta-model
  elements for these such as "section", etc. Annoyingly, this also
  means converting expressions such as =some text=. This will be
  trickier.
- in an ideal world we would also have entities such as paragraphs and
  the like, to ensure we can reformat the text as required. For
  example, the 80 column limitation we have in the input may not be
  suitable for the end format (this is the case with markdown).
- we are using qualified names, e.g. =entities::attribute=. These need
  to be removed. We need to move the graphing logic into =codec=. See
  story for this.
- All models should have a unique ID for each element. The ID should
  be based on GUIDs where possible, though there are some difficulties
  for cases like Dia. We could create a "fixed" function that
  generates GUIDs from dia IDs. For example:

: <dia:childnode parent="O64"/>

  We could take the id =O64= and normalise it to say 4 digits: =6400=
  (noticed we removed the =O= as its not valid in hex); and then use a
  well-defined GUID prefix:

: 3dddc237-3771-45be-82c9-937c5cef

  Then we can append the normalised Dia ID to the prefix. This would
  ensure we always generate the same GUIDs on conversion from Dia. If
  the GUIds change within Dia, then they will also change in the
  conversion. This ID is then used as the codec ID. Note that its the
  responsibility of the decoder to assign "child node IDs". For JSON
  this must already be populated. For Dia its the =childnode=
  field. For org-mode, we need to infer it from the structure of the
  file. In org-mode we just need to use the =:CUSTOM_ID:= attribute:

: :CUSTOM_ID: 7c38f8ef-0c8c-4f17-a7da-7ed7d5eedeff

- qualified names are computed as a transform via the graph in codec
  model. Fixed.
- packages/namespaces do not have a stereotype in org document. In
  fact nor do regular objects. We need to figure out the logic for
  meta-types. Done.
- no space between headline and comment when there are no
  properties. Done.

List of problems found in current models:

- upper case all drawer contents to see if it fixes github
  rendering. We need to downcase when transforming into codec. We can
  keep tags in lower-case at it seems to work ok with
  github. Actually, maybe we should add support for both lower and
  upper case just as a test before we update all drawers. It looks
  pretty bad all in upper case as well. We could not get this to work
  with github. Perhaps the problem is that we use separators in the
  keys (dots, underscores). We do not have a good solution to replace
  these.
- consider removing =masd_= in tags. Just makes them longer and adds
  no value. Actually, we'll keep these for now to make sure its clear
  the document is a "masd" document.
- try adding =references= tag. Content is a list of links to org
  models. However, because of the way our referencing works in dogen,
  we need to do some kind of hack. Perhaps the "text" of the link
  could be the simple path to the file and the link the relative
  path. To start off with, it can be ignored and managed
  manually. This will be spun into its own story for the future.
- add spaces between drawers and comments. Seems like we are already
  doing this.
- inject the custom ID into all headlines. See previous analysis on
  this. Spun into its own story, not deemed critical.

Problems after removal:

- need to add containing element ID from Dia or else we will have to

  we've survived this far we can leave it at that. Actually, the
  deletion happens on initialise, so we're probably OK.

Org documents would be much more readable if we allowed spaces in the

camel case) as part of the pipeline. We could also do the reverse when
converting the models into org mode.

Notes:

- in order for this to work, we need some kind of flag to skip types

  Notes:

- It seems we need to use proper scoping if we want the elements to
  come out in the right namespaces. We can take the same approach as
  we did for org using a recursion on containment. However, we need to
  make sure the org codec is populating =containing_element_id=
  correctly.
- we need to create targets that:
  1. detect plant uml binary
  2. generate all plant uml files
  3. convert files to PNGs.
- add support for inheritance. We need to somehow know if we are in
  the same model or not. We could do an element look-up; if found we
  add the link, if not we ignore it.
- we could use a similar approach for relationships: only extract the
  nesting and then create a relationship only if the type is in the
  model.
- when we add transforms as meta-elements, we can add the dependencies
  between them. This would allow us to create the links in UML.

*** Add include directories to models                                 :story:

In some cases we may require additional include directories to be
added to a project. It should be possible to add these to a product or
component. We need to find a specific use case for this though.

Actually, we should just support a =--include-dir= or =-I=
parameter. We also need to dump the include directories in dumpspecs.

*** Add models directory to each component                            :story:

Instead of a product level models directory, we should have separate
component level directories. We can't do the PMM implementation just
yet but we can use regexes to get the directory in the correct shape
and then use it to target the changes in the PMM. The directory should
be called =modeling= to reflect the fact that it will contain more
than models.

Notes:

- when we do this we will break the dogen product unit tests.

*** Move hello world model from models directory                      :story:

It is confusing to have it mixed up with product models. Use a regular
dogen model to test the package. We could have it on the reference
model as a stand alone example, or we could create a "hello dogen"
product for a trivial example of dogen usage.

Actually, we need to address the entire samples use case. The easy
thing to do is just to add all dogen org models as examples. Or we
could just add the hello world model.

Merged stories:

*Create or update samples folder*

We should add samples to the package. These could be organsided by
injector (dia, json), then by language type (lam, cpp, csharp) or vice
versa.

We could also try to generate all of these models when testing the
package.

On the other hand, once we create a proper package for dogen headers,
with SOs etc, we should really include the dogen models there. In
effect, it will be symmetric with PDM packages.

*** Remove dia-specific types in dia model                            :story:

We probably don't need the "processed" types, we can just use the
codec types directly.

*** Refactor the templating model                                     :story:

We should use "standard" conventions in this model as well:

- add entities namespace. Name entities after their "type",
  e.g. =stitch_template=, etc.
- add transforms for the template expansion.

*** Consider handling "dia comments" in a general manner              :story:

At present we allow comments with:

: #DOGEN masd.codec.dia.comment=true

to be processed as part of the containing object. We should try to
generalise this notion so that any codec could make use of this
feature.

*** Move graph of containment to codec model                          :story:

At present we are doing the containment graph within the dia codec. We
should really do this in the main codec model so we can reuse it for
org-mode.

*** Move wale templates to TS namespaces                              :story:

At present the wale templates are in the top-level namespace of the
text model, but they should really be in each technical space.

Merged stories:

*Move mustache templates into the =transforms= namespaces*

We left the templates at the top level as it was in the TS-specific
models but they should really be within =transforms= namespace. We
need to check to see how name resolution for templates is working.

*** Implement M2T chains via code generation                          :story:

We need to update the =backend= and =part= transforms to be a set of
calls to their "children", based on the PMM. Once this is done we can
remove all of the existing infrastructure in the TS models:

- repositories
- initialisers
- workflows
- traits
- registrars

Notes:

- in the new world we no longer need a M2T interface at the text
  transform level. The backend chain knows of all of the facet chains;
  and the facet chains know of all of the archetypes. We can dispatch
  the element using the visitor into a concrete type and then find the
  archetypes that process that type. However, we do not want to
  generate an apply method per logical element...

Merged stories:

*Implement backend and facet transform*

The backend transform should:

- return the ID of the backend;
- use the facet and archetype transforms to process all elements.

Check backlog for a story on this.

*** Consider renaming =text= to =logical_physical=                    :story:

This is really the right name for the model; the text processing part
are the transforms that are done on the model.

Notes:

- rename =logical_physical_region= to just =region=.
- actually another way of looking at this is trying to figure out what
  is the dominant responsibility of the component. The LPS will
  probably be 2 or 3 types whereas the M2T transforms will be 99% of
  the types. We probably should name the model after lps and the
  component after the M2Ts. So rename instead the model to LPS.

*** Deprecate managed directories                                     :story:

There should only be one "managed directory" at the input stage, which
is the component directory (for component models). If parts have
relative directories off of the component directory then we should add
to the list of managed directories inside the PM pipeline.

*** Validate no two artefacts have the same ID                        :story:

At present it is possible to generate two artefacts with the same path
(which is the physical ID) and then have them overwrite each
other. This causes diffs that are very difficult to get to the bottom
of. It would be better to fail with a validation that detects
duplicates.

Merged stories:

*Add a validator for text model*

The validator should check the paths. This can also be done in
physical model.

:                 /*
:                  * FIXME: we are still generating artefacts for global
:                  * module.
:                  */
:                 if (aptr->file_path().empty()) {
:                     BOOST_LOG_SEV(lg, error) << empty_path
:                                              << aptr->name().id();
:                     // BOOST_THROW_EXCEPTION(transform_exception(empty_path +
:                     //         aptr->name().id().value()));
:                     continue;
:                 }

*** Fix name of configuration tracing file                            :story:

This name looks incorrect:

: 00000-configuration--initial_input.json

*** Rename =name= to =codec= name                                     :story:

- add codec ID to name.

Notes:

- variability is also using the name class.

*** Add descriptions to PMM elements                                  :story:

We need to read a description attribute for:

- backend
- facet
- part
- archetype

And populate these on the LM PMM, and then code generate them. The
description should be the comment of the associated element.

*** Create a physical ID in logical-physical space                    :story:

Artefacts are points in logical-physical space. They should have an ID
which is composed by both logical and physical location. We could
create a very simple builder that concatenates both, for example:

: <dogen><variability><entities><default_value_override>|<masd><cpp><types><class_header>

The use of =|= would make it really easy to split out IDs as required,
and to visually figure out which part is which. Note though that the
ID is an opaque identifier and the splitting happens for
troubleshooting purposes only, not in the code. With the physical
model, all references are done using these IDs. So for example, if an
artefact =a0= depends on artefact =a1=, the dependency is recorded as
the ID of =a1=. The physical model should also be indexed by ID
instead of being a list of artefacts.

We already created =logical_meta_physical_id= type so maybe we don't
need this ID as well.

*** codecs: encoders and decoders should work in terms of strings     :story:

We should only have strings (or perhaps streams) in the encoder and
decoder interfaces. The handling of files should be the responsibility
of the caller.

*** Factor out duplication in stitch and wale templates               :story:

At present we are duplicating a lot of stuff in stitch templates. If
we look at the directives, we can group them as follows:

1. Hard-coded. These have the same value for all templates:

: <#@ masd.stitch.stream_variable_name=ast.stream() #>
: <#@ masd.stitch.inclusion_dependency=<boost/throw_exception.hpp> #>
: <#@ masd.stitch.inclusion_dependency="dogen.utility/types/log/logger.hpp" #>
: <#@ masd.stitch.inclusion_dependency="dogen.physical/types/helpers/meta_name_factory.hpp" #>
: <#@ masd.stitch.inclusion_dependency="dogen.logical/types/helpers/meta_name_factory.hpp" #>
: <#@ masd.stitch.inclusion_dependency="dogen.text.cpp/types/traits.hpp" #>
: <#@ masd.stitch.inclusion_dependency="dogen.text.cpp/types/transforms/traits.hpp" #>
: <#@ masd.stitch.inclusion_dependency="dogen.text.cpp/types/transforms/assistant.hpp" #>
: <#@ masd.stitch.inclusion_dependency="dogen.text.cpp/types/transforms/inclusion_constants.hpp" #>
: <#@ masd.stitch.inclusion_dependency="dogen.text.cpp/types/transforms/formatting_error.hpp" #>
: <#@ masd.stitch.inclusion_dependency="dogen.text/types/formatters/sequence_formatter.hpp" #>
: <#@ masd.stitch.wale.kvp.meta_name_factory=logical::helpers::meta_name_factory #>

2. Facet-dependent. These have the same value for a given facet:

: <#@ masd.stitch.containing_namespaces=dogen::text::cpp::transforms::types #>
: <#@ masd.stitch.inclusion_dependency="dogen.text.cpp/types/transforms/types/traits.hpp" #>

3. Meta-element dependent. If we know who the meta-element is, we can
   generate these:

: <#@ masd.stitch.inclusion_dependency="dogen.logical/types/entities/structural/object.hpp" #>
: <#@ masd.stitch.wale.kvp.yarn_element=logical::entities::structural::object #>
: <#@ masd.stitch.wale.kvp.meta_element=object #>

4. M2T transform dependent. If we know the name of the transform, we
   can generate these:

: <#@ masd.stitch.wale.kvp.class.simple_name=class_implementation_transform #>
: <#@ masd.stitch.wale.kvp.archetype.simple_name=class_implementation #>
: <#@ masd.stitch.inclusion_dependency="dogen.text.cpp/types/transforms/types/class_implementation_transform.hpp" #>

5. Not needed in the new world:

: <#@ masd.stitch.wale.text_template=cpp_artefact_transform_implementation.wale #>

6. Are dependent on the content of the template and so must be added manually:

: <#@ masd.stitch.inclusion_dependency="dogen.text.cpp/types/transforms/io/traits.hpp" #>
: <#@ masd.stitch.inclusion_dependency="dogen.text.cpp/types/transforms/io/inserter_implementation_helper.hpp" #>

We can address the first point and possibly the second point by
creating profiles. For point 3 and 4 we could inject these values as
part of transforms. Finally, we could so some simple filtering of
meta-data: any key starting with =masd.stitch.= is added to the KVP
container for the template. Some of these are injected manually.

Sadly we cannot share profiles between C++ and C# because at present
we cannot inherit across models. We could consider fixing this via
meta-data. Actually having said that we need to be able to use:

: masd.variability.profile = dogen.profiles.base.disable_all_facets

In the same model; this may work across models as well (modulus
possible problems with merging).

At any rate the profiles should be kept within the =text*= models
given they are used only for M2T transforms.

*** Stitch templates should be bound to Dogen M2T transforms          :story:

At present we have tried to create some kind of generic implementation
of a templating engine. However in practice we only need it for the
implementation of the apply method of a M2T transform. We could take
advantage of this in order to simplify templates; we could assume that
the only thing we could code-generate in a stitch template is the
inside of the apply method. We need to check but T4 does something
similar. This would mean that many things would be hard-coded such as
the name of the stream variable etc.

Everything else should be supplied as meta-data parameters to the
modeling element for archetypes: includes, etc. This means the
templates would be much simpler. This can only be done once we use the
PMM to compute paths. Also, we probably require a way to inject the
dependencies. This will probably require merging code generation as
well.

Also this can only be done when we remove the current implementation
of helpers and move to PDMs.

*** Name all transform exceptions consistently                        :story:

It seems on engine we call them "transform exception" but on assets we
call them "transformation error". Check all other models and them
these consistently.

Merged stories:

*Rename =transformation_error= to =transform_exception=*

In keeping with the framework guidelines for naming exceptions. We need to
also look at all other exceptions.

** Deprecated

*** CANCELLED Consider moving helper chain to outside the text transforms :story:
    CLOSED: [2020-12-18 Fri 09:01]

*Rationale*: helpers are only temporary so lets not waste any extra
engineering on them.

Given helpers are temporary this may not make a lot of sense, but for
what its worth, we could run the chain prior to executing the text
transforms and then supply a string parameter with the helper
text. This way the assistant would do less and there would be less
code in each text transform.

*** CANCELLED Rename "model-to-X" to TLAs                             :story:
    CLOSED: [2020-12-18 Fri 09:01]

Given that model-to-text (M2T) and text-to-model (T2M) - to a lesser
extent - are well known TLAs in MDE we should make use of these in
class names. The names we have at present are very long. The
additional size is not providing any benefits.

*** CANCELLED Merge properties factory with stitching factory         :story:
    CLOSED: [2020-12-18 Fri 09:03]

In stitch we still have a few classes that are light on
responsibilities. One case is the stitching properties factory, traits
etc. We should merge all of this into a single class, properties
factory.
