# Introduction

This sprint achieved the long standing objective of moving profiles into the meta-model. We've also continued the work on cleaning up models to better align them to [MDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_engineering) terminology.

# User visible changes

This section covers stories that affect end users. The sprint demo provides a quick demonstration of the user visible changes, whereas the below sections provide more detail.

[![Sprint 1.0.16 Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/3XrHSFkdVps/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/3XrHSFkdVps)

## Profiles as meta-model elements

The key story of the sprint was to move variability profiles into the meta-model. For those less familiar with Dogen's variability profiles, the basic idea is that you can create "canned" sets of configurations and then apply them to modeling elements via UML stereotypes.

We had alread made decorations metamodel elements in [sprint 14](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/releases/tag/v1.0.14); now that we are also treating profiles as a regular meta-model elements,  we have the core features in place to allow users to start defining [SPLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_product_line). You can create an SPL by creating a shared model containing all of the required configuration such as profiles, decorations etc and then make use of these in the models that make up the product line. As an example, in Dogen we created the ["profiles" model](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/tree/master/projects/masd.dogen.models/dia) ```masd.dogen.profiles.dia```.

![Dogen's Profiles Model](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/raw/master/doc/blog/images/profiles_model.png)

The name is not exactly ideal as the model can contain more than just profiles, so we are still searching for a more fitting denomination. The fundamental idea is clear, though: to have a central place where all the configuration of the product is stored, and use to create "a language" at the product level, imbued with product specific meaning. For example, one could define profiles such as ```hashable```, ```serialisable``` and so forth and then configure these with specific features. ```hashable``` could be mapped to the ```std::hash``` facet, serialisable to the Boost Serialisation facet and so forth. All of the mapping and naming is defined by the end user. In Dogen we define ```masd::pretty_printable``` as follows (using JSON notation):

```json
    {
      "name": "composable::pretty_printable",
      "parents": [
        "composable::code_generated"
      ],
      "documentation": "The element has the ability to dump itself to a stream.\n",
      "stereotypes": [
        "masd::variability::profile_template"
      ],
      "tagged_values": {
        "masd.variability.binding_point": "element",
        "masd.variability.labels": "masd::pretty_printable"
      },
      "attributes": [
        {
          "name": "masd.generation.cpp.io.enabled",
          "type": "",
          "value": "true",
          "tagged_values": {
            "masd.variability.archetype_location.kernel": "masd",
            "masd.variability.archetype_location.backend": "masd.generation.cpp",
            "masd.variability.template_kind": "instance"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
```

Any modeling element with the stereotype of ```masd::pretty_printable``` will now have the ability to dump itself into a stream via the ```masd.generation.cpp.io``` facet.

There are a couple of caveats to this feature. Firstly, we are yet to find a good domain based name for what are are calling thus far "profiles". The name is somewhat confusing, because Dogen's variability profiles are entirely unrelated to UML profiles. Our search through the literature continues, so in the future it is entirely possible that profiles will be renamed to a more fitting term.

Secondly, this release only adds the _foundational_ infrastructure for SPL. Many domain elements still need to be added to complete the SPL story, such as the concept of a product, build systems, etc. However, these features are already useful enough, and simplified Dogen's internals considerably.

## Removal of "stand-alone" weaving

In the past it was possible to instantiate stitch templates directly from Dogen, using the weaving command, e.g.:

```
$ masd.dogen.cli weave -t model.dia
```

However, due to the changes done in variability management, stitch templates are no longer instantiable without going through the entire processing pipeline for models. As such, the feature no longer makes sense, so it was removed.

The long term plan is to remove variability support from stitch templates; once that is in place, we can add weaving once more - though its usefulness in this fashion is somewhat debatable. We shall await for concrete use cases before working on this feature; for now, the story was moved to the bottom of the [product backlog](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/product_backlog.org#consider-adding-weaving-support-as-a-command).

# Development Matters

In this section we cover topics that are mainly of interest if you follow Dogen development, such as details on internal stories that consumed significant resources, important events, etc. As usual, for all the gory details of the work carried out this sprint, see the [sprint log](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/v1/sprint_backlog_16.org).

## Significant Internal Stories

Rather unusually, this sprint was _extremely_ delivery focused, so there were no significant internal stories to speak of.

## Resourcing

Amazingly, over 87% of the total ask was taken by stories directly related to the sprint's mission -  probably a first in Dogen's development history. The remaining 13% of the time was spent as follows. Release related activities for the previous sprint cost around 5%, including activities such editing the release notes and creating the demo. Backlog grooming was shy of 5%, and around 1.3% of the total ask was spent on reading the academic literature on variability. Spikes had a cost of less than 2%, with the nursing of builds taking 0.8% and Emacs related work only 0.4%. Overall, it was an extremely efficient sprint.

## Planning

The plan is proceeding as expected. At the end of sprint 16, the plan looks like this:

![Resource Allocation Graph](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/raw/master/doc/agile/v1/sprint_16_resource_allocation_graph.png)

# Next Sprint

The focus on Sprint 17 is to address the other side of variability: the definition of new features. At present we are manually creating features, involving both the creation of the feature definition on its own JSON file and then the source code to implement the reading of the feature from a modeling element. The vision is that the code generator should create code for all of this, off the back of a modeling element (say ```masd::feature_group```). Work has started on this in sprint 16, so hopefully it will be completed in sprint 17.

We seem to have made some mistake when processing profile templates:
when we define them directly on a target model we fail with an
error. The problem is probably to do with the fact that we do not set
the meta-model information on these new types. We should try something
similar for all meta-types such as decorations, etc.

At present we cannot make a reference to a type in a "inner"
module. Take type T defined in namespace N. Assume N::M with type
R. In T we should be able to refer to M::R without any further
qualification because N contains both T and M. However, at present the
resolver cannot find M::R unless we specify N::M::R.

At present we have a flat namespace for all elements in coding. This
had served us well up to recently, but with the proliferation of
metamodel elements, it is becoming a bit unwieldy. This will get a lot
worse once we move the fabric types. Its probably best if we partition
elements into their own namespaces, such as:

- decoration
- variability
- cpp
- csharp
- build
- etc.

Actually we now have only the "core" elements outside a namespace. In
reality, these are "structural" elements. Create a namespace for them
as well.

    :END:

It seems we are not adding leaves to parents if they are located in
internal modules. It could also be because the generalisation
relationship comes about via meta-data rather than UML generalisation.

Actually the problem is related to how we were bucketing the leaves
when generating the visitor: we were splitting them by internal
modules, resulting in multiple visitors per model. We now bucket them
by model instead.

Whenever we bump into a problem we seem to spend a lot of time going
through the log files and trace files trying to figure out where the
problem is happening. Have a quick go in trying to implement a
relational model for tracing to see if we can transfer the bulk of the
data into a relational format which we can query via SQL.

We've created a basic relational model for tracing. The relational
part of it seems straightforward (ish); the problem is the integration
of the tracer with the relational model. At present we rely on the
fact that all traceable objects have IO enabled; this works because
the code generator creates the IO facet, which is then used by the
write method in utility to convert any model type into a
string. However, we now need to change the approach: we need multiple
tracing backends:

- file tracer
- database tracer.

The file tracer is more or less the current tracer. The database
tracer needs to decompose the objects in existing models into a
relational representation. In an ideal world, the user would configure
the tracer to use one of the two backends and the remaining usage
would be transparent. However, we cannot have an interface for the
tracer backend that uses template methods because then we'd need
virtual template functions, it seems.

Another alternative is to make the tracer aware of the model objects
it is tracing. This is also not ideal because we would create cycles
int he design.

In effect we need to somehow implement a similar approach to the existing
tracer: rely on global template functions a-la =operator<<= to
decompose objects into their relational representations and then
supply those to the backend. It is not very clear how this would
work. For now we've postponed this approach as it seems its not going
to be a quick win.

We should approach this incrementally. Next time we have a bit of
spare time, we need to generate the model and then create the adapters
from existing models. Finally we can look at how it will be integrated
with tracing.

At present our Linux and OSX build is much bigger than our windows
builds (3.8 MB on Windows vs 31 MB OSX and 15 MB on Linux). The
problem appears to be that we are not stripping the binaries on Linux.

We tried manually stripping:

:     # strip the binaries in release
:    set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE "${CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE} -s")
:    set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE} -s")

However clang does not support this.

This may be related to the CMake build type of MinRelSize. Try doing a
build with this and see if the binaries are smaller. Actually this
does not work. We also tried:

: CMAKE_INSTALL_DO_STRIP

Which seems to have some effect but not exactly the same as a command
line =strip=. Supposedly this is a install level strip.

The only solution that appears to work is to add a custom command to
all targets in the build to strip:

: add_custom_command(TARGET ${target} POST_BUILD
:        COMMAND ${EMBREE_SIGN_FILE} $<TARGET_FILE:${target}>)

However we need to be careful because stripping shared libraries may
cause problems. Also this is done for every build.

Dogen should generate code for the following:

- definition of a feature template, as per the existing data
  files. The approach should be very similar to what we did with
  profiles. With this we have features as a meta-model element.
- a concrete class to represent the feature group.
- code to read the concrete class out of the dynamic configuration
  (e.g. a "feature deserialiser" if you like).

Problems:

- we are defining a new binding point rather than binding; this means
  that the logic for checking the bindings no longer works. For
  example, we could be creating a new global binding point in a
  property.

: #DOGEN masd.variability.binding_point=global

Notes:

- create a feature template list with the feature templates defined in
  the meta-model.
- find a way to retrieve all of the feature template lists created in
  each model from engine.
- find a way to supply the list of lists to the variability subsystem
  in the feature model production chain.
- the user creates a feature group. On construction, it will query the
  feature model for all of its features and setup its feature group.
- users can then call =read= on a dynamic configuration to create
  static configurations.
- variability needs a feature template registrar that keeps track of
  all the available feature templates. It is supplied into the feature
  model production chain from the engine.
- all models that make use of features need a feature template
  initialiser. It calls the registrar with all the features in that
  model.

Tasks:

- rename =feature_template_group_registrar= to
  =feature_template_initializer=.
- rename =feature_template_group= to =feature_bundle=. The feature
  bundle gives rise to: feature templates, feature group, static
  configuration.
- create a registrar in variability that keeps track of the feature
  templates (=feature_template_registrar=?).
- create a variability type mapper that returns the dynamic type
  (e.g. from =masd::variability::text= returns the text enumeration)
  or the C++ type (returns =std::string=).
- create a static method in the =feature_bundle= that returns a list
  of feature templates (=make_templates=?).
- create a static method in the initializer that calls all feature
  bundles and retrieves the list of all feature templates, and
  populates the registrar.
- in engine, call all feature template initializers.
- update the variability feature model chain to receive the feature
  registrar as input.
- update all models to define features in the meta-model.
- remove all JSON files.

Notes:

- the formatter is a feature. The postfix, enabled etc should be with
  the formatter itself and it should register the feature. However,
  the problem is then with the static representation of the
  configuration. But perhaps this is not needed?
- why are there multiple decoration related fields? some are
  =masd.decoration= others are
  =masd.generation.decoration=. Investigate how they are used.
- archetype location properties are not useful for instance templates.
  We should not require them in this case. We could make the location
  optional on the template.

At the moment we are confusing Dogen quite a lot with MASD. There
should be a clear separation between these two:

- MASD provides a theoretical framework, together with a meta-model
  and a feature model.
- Dogen is a reference implementation of this framework.

We should not use the prefix =masd= on anything unless it belongs to
the MASD framework. The question to ask is: "if we had a second
implementation of MASD, would it have to know about this concept?" If
the answer is no, then the concept should not be under the MASD
namespace.

Tasks:

- drop =masd= namespace from all dogen models.
- drop =masd= namespace from all test models.
- drop =masd= namespace from all profiles.

*Previous Understanding*

At present we have stereotypes such as =masd::handcrafted::typeable=
etc. However, the namespace =masd= in this context is not meant to
imply these are defined inside the MASD public UML profile. In fact,
should we really call dogen =masd::dogen=?

Whilst dogen is an implementation of MASD, it is not inside the MASD
namespace - in the sense that things defined in dogen are
implementation specific. If we has simply =dogen=, we could then
reserve the =masd= namespace for things that are actually in the MASD
spec. Similarly for the reference models. The question is whether
reference implementations should exist under the MASD umbrella or
not. Say for example a third party implements the MASD spec; we
wouldn't expect them to place it under the MASD namespace.

In a somewhat similar vein, we have the =masd= model in library. This
contains elements which are directly usable by end users (licences for
example) and others which are less so - generation markers are more of
an example rather than what we expect users to use. Modelines are
somewhere in between.

For symmetry:

Actually we cannot call the method =from_simple_string= as we cannot
overload based on return types. In addition, with C++ 98 we may also
have problems overloading based on plain enums - needs
investigation. The names will have to reflect the enum name
too. Perhaps:

- =qualified_string_to_technical_space=
- =simple_string_to_technical_space=
- =qualified_string_to_technical_space=

In addition, the conversion to string requires a bit of thinking. We
don't want to create strings on the heap needlessly, but supporting
C++98 means we can't just use string view. Besides we don't even know
how string view will integrated with the existing code.

A slightly better approach may be to rely on lexical cast. We can
create a new facet specifically for this and specialise it only for
enums for now. We could try to make no allocations as well using
=char*= and =strncmp=.

Notes:

- problems with c++ 98 model: tests are running on c++ 17. This is not
  a huge problem normally, but we now have some header only code which
  is actually only being validated for c++ 17. We need to remove all
  autos from the tests plus fix semi-colons, etc.
- need a way to obtain a qualified name to the enumerator in C++ 98
  style (e.g. skipping the enumeration).

Our colours model has become really confusing:

- it is located in the test model but it really is trying to
  demonstrate MASD specific properties.
- we are including colours for test model specific profiles.

What we really need is to split it:

- a model representing the MASD palette with only MASD-specific
  stereotypes, which should be part of Dogen and shipped with the
  package.
- a model representing the dogen palette.
- a model representing the test models palette. Note that we have not
  created a profile for C# yet.

Now that we started to see PDMs as a solution for proxy models, the
logical consequence is that mappings too are meta-model elements. In
effect, it is a meta-model element that maps two model elements. So
users can create their own mappings if required and PIMs then become a
user level option. We can of course provide LAM, both as an example
and proof of concept but users are free to create their own
mappings. A few things are needed:

- all mappings must be processed first. This is because when we load
  models we do the mapping.
- a model should state if its a PSM or a PIM. If a PSM it must
  reference one or more mapping models. It must not reference any
  PSMs.
- mapping models should have references to PSMs. These are loaded on
  demand if, after mapping, we find types being referenced (e.g. get a
  list of all referenced models after mapping, check for their
  presence in references list and load them).

Actually the right way to achieve this is to have "proxy model
elements". These cannot be used by themselves; they exist merely to
signify a mapping point. Then, on the regular models we define the
mapping (e.g. =std::string= has a mapping to a proxy element in
LAM). The mapping is not used when you include =std=, only when you
include =lam= (e.g. when we detect the presence of the proxy
elements). This means its now very easy to add new mappings (just add
them to new models). Note also that the technical space of the mapping
is inferred from the TS of the model with the mapping (e.g. c++ in the
case of =std=). We need to:

- create a model called LAM.
- define a new type of meta-model element for the mapping (look for
  better names).
- define a new meta-data key for the mapping.
- create a new mapping transform (post-assembly) that looks for proxy
  elements and their mappings; it uses those to build the existing
  mapping structures. The rest of the mapping process remains as is -
  i.e. the output of this transform should match the hydrator.

Notes:

- defining variability as a mapping model may not be a good
  idea. First because we need to map things such as =text_collection=
  to =std::list<std::string= but the mapping system was not designed
  to do 1-N mappings, just 1-1 mappings. In truth, we should really
  have a =collection<text>= as a composite type, but refactoring the
  type system of variability is a fair amount of work and we do not
  yet have a use case to justify it. Second, we only have a fixed set
  of mappings for variability types and these are not going to
  change. If they do, all the client code will break. Similarly, we
  only need mappings for C++ because that's where we will always use
  this code. All and all, we just need some special purpose mapping
  for variability. However, we do not want to fall through the same
  trap as we did for formatter includes: bypassing the model type
  system is a bad idea. We need some kind of "soft mapping" for this
  particular case, that associates a variability type to a name or
  naem tree (e.g. =text_collection=) and then have that name or name
  tree go through the usual processing (resolving, etc). Thus we could
  create two separate concepts for mapping (open and closed, something
  like this). For variability we just need closed mapping. We can then
  use the feature template properties plus the mapping to construct an
  structural object which is owned by the binding. This will be used
  to create the struct.
- final approach is to have two separate types. For the extensible
  mappables, the processing is as follows:
  - at the engine level, we first adapt the types as usual.
  - then, we traverse the entire model set looking for objects,
    primitives or builtins that are mapped. We keep track of their
    name, TS and action and the target of the mapping. A single
    container of target to list of destination suffices.
  - in coding, in the mappings transform, we read the extensible
    mappings container and create a mapping repository. We need to use
    the new action enum here.
- for the fixed mappings:
  - we can read them in the adapter as usual.
  - then at the engine level we read the untyped destination.
  - then the parsing transform creates the name tree.
  - the merger merges all the mappings.
  - the resolver transform resolves the name tree.
  - a feature bundle transform at the post-assembly level creates the
    inner object. It uses the fixed mappings of the target model to
    resolve the properties into a name tree.
  - formatter then expresses it as a struct.
- at present we are "mapping" agnostic models into concrete TS. This
  happens because the mapping code always maps, regardless. The net
  result is that this "mapping" is merely the copying across of
  elements plus (very significantly) the changing of the model TS from
  agnostic into a concrete TS. Without this the merger will just
  ignore the model.
- mapping happens right before merging. This means that we cannot rely
  on the mappings being made available to the model currently being
  mapped as we had assumed. We need to find some way to ensure the
  mappings are made available to all models. We need to change the
  assembly, mapping and merge transforms to take in model sets. In the
  merge transform we need to first locate all the mappings and build
  the repository, then map all models.

Merged Stories:

*Allow users to choose mapping sets*

At present we load the "default" mappings, which are also the only
mappings available. It is entirely possible that users will not agree
with those mappings. If we add a name to the mappings, and provide a
meta-data tag to choose mappings we can then allow users to provide
their own and set the meta-data accordingly. Mapper then reads the
meta-data in the model and uses the requested element map. For this we
need to name the element maps and we also need to create a "mapping
set". These can be indexed by name in the mapping repository. Mapper
chooses the mapping set to use.

In keeping with the idea that profiles are model-level concepts,
mappings should be too. We should be able to import mappings in a UML
diagram and override them or define new ones too.

*** COMPLETED LAM types should exist as a model                       :story:
    CLOSED: [2019-05-17 Fri 10:20]

*Rationale*: implemented as part of moving mappings into the meta-model.

At present we use LAM as a conceptual device: we don't even have a LAM
model. Users create attributes with LAM types and we map them to
concrete technical spaces such as C++ and C#. However, this means we
do not even resolve lam types, nor do we tell users what types are
available. A better approach would be to create a LAM model with types
and make the mappings properties of the types themselves. these can
now be placed under the =masd= namespace: =masd::lannguage_agnostic=,
=masd::la= or maybe =masd::pim=. This should be done when we place
mappings in the meta-model.

Tasks:

- create a templating namespace in coding. Add a template to it.
- create a formatter that writes templating elements into a
  project-level =templates= directory. We need to always have
  overwrite off for templates (e.g. it only makes sense for them to be
  handcrafted).
- references to wale templates now become just templates (in
  preparation to changing it to a moustache like approach).
- paths to wale templates are relative to the templates folder.

Notes:

- we called these elements =logic_less_templates= to reflect the idea
  that wale, mustche etc templates are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustache_(template_system)][logic-less]]. However, the more
  important trait here maybe that the templates are "stand alone";
  that is, these templates are not a facet of an existing modeling
  element. It is entirely possible to have a logic-less template
  directly associated with an existing modeling element just like we
  do with "logic-full" templates (e.g. stitch).

*Move wale templates from the data directory*

At present we have wale templates under the data directory. This is
not the right location. These are part of a model just like stitch
templates. There is one slight wrinkle though: if a user attempts to
create a dogen formatter (say if plugins were supported), then we need
access to the template from the debian package. So whilst they should
live in the appropriate model (e.g. =generation.cpp=,
=generation.csharp=), they also need to be packaged and shipped.

Interestingly, so will all dogen models which are defining annotations
and profiles. We need to rethink the data directory, separating system
models from dogen models somehow. In effect, the data directory will
be, in the future, the system models directory.

So, in conclusion, two use cases for wale templates:

- regular model defines a wale template and makes use of it. Template
  should be with the model, just like stitch templates. However,
  unlike stitch, there should be a directory for them.
- user model wants to define a new formatter. It will make use of
  dogen profiles and wale templates. These must be in the future data
  directory somehow.

Actually, the right thing to do is to make wale templates themselves
model elements:

- we may want to use a wale template in a different model. This is the
  use case for when users want to create new formatters to add to an
  existing backend.
- we don't want to add additional regular expressions to ignore wale
  templates; we've already seen how this is a bad idea (for example
  with tests).
- whilst adding templates to a model element is not ideal if the model
  element is in dia or JSON, these are really limitations of the
  injector format rather than of the idea itself. Ideally, we should
  have an injector format that supports this use case (another use
  case for developing a =org_uml= injector).

Notes:

- automatically ignore wale templates by looking at the input
  meta-data.
- make wale template input path relative to the output directory.

** Deprecated
*** CANCELLED Consider adding enumerations in dynamic                 :story:
    CLOSED: [2019-05-10 Fri 11:45]

*Rationale*: we do not want to further complicate the variability
model. Instead, we shall code generate the conversion into the static
type via the enumeration "from string" methods.

This story is bound to already exist in backlog so do another
search. The idea is that we should be able to define a field and all
of its valid values. For extra bonus points, we should be able to
assign an enumeration and get the string conversion done
automatically; for example by having a string to enum code generated,
and supplying that function as a type parameter into dynamic. Then
dynamic's field selector would create the instances of the enumeration.

Previous stories:

*Create a domain field definitions*

In addition to default values, it should be possible to supply a list
of possible values for a field definition - a domain. When processing
the values we can then check that it is part of the domain and if not
throw. This is required for the include types and for the family
types. At present this is only applicable to string fields.

In this sense, =boolean= is just a special case where the list is know
up front. We should re-implement =boolean= this way. Possibly even add
synonyms (e.g. =true=, =false=, =0=, =1=)?
