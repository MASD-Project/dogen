Title: Dogen v1.0.09, "Kubata"

#+begin_src markdown
![Kubata](http://www.africavernaculararchitecture.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Angola-Flickr-Rob-and-Sophie55061521f2fff.jpg) _Traditional Angolan village house. [(C) Rob and Sophie](http://www.africavernaculararchitecture.com/angola/)_.

# Overview

As described on [the previous sprint](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/releases/tag/v1.0.08), the key objective at present is to get all the infrastructure up-to-date after a hiatus of a year or so of development. This is a requirement so that we can move to C++ 17 and start to make use of all the nice new libraries available. As such, this sprint was entirely taken with infrastructure clean up. Whilst these changes are not user visible, they still provide important benefits to project development so we'll briefly summarise them here.

## MASD Project Transition

We have started to sync up the work on the PhD with the work on Dogen. This sprint, the main focus was on creating an organisation solely for _Model Assisted Software Development_ (more details on that in the future), and moving all of the infrastructure to match - [Bintray](https://bintray.com/masd-project/main/dogen), [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/MASD-Project/dogen/builds), [Gitter](https://gitter.im/MASD-Project/Lobby) and the like.

## Move to vcpkg

Historically, we've always had a problem in keeping dogen's dependencies up-to-date across the three supported platforms. The problem stems from a lack of a cross-platform package manager in C++. Whilst we tried [Conan](https://conan.io/) in the past, we never managed to get it working properly for our setup. With this sprint we started the move towards using [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Whilst it still has some deficiencies, it addresses our use case particularly well and will allow us to pick up new dependencies fairly easily going forward. This is crucial as we expand the number of facets available, which hopefully will happen over the next couple of months. In this sprint we have completed the transition to vcpkg for Linux and Windows; the next sprint will be OSX's turn. With the introduction of vcpkg we took the opportunity to upgrade to [boost 1.68](https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_68_0.html) on Linux and Windows.

## Add CDash support

Since we moved away from our own infrastructure we lost the ability to know which tests are passing and how long test execution is taking. With this sprint we resurrected CDash/CTest support, with a new dashboard, available [here](https://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=MASD+Project+-+Dogen). There are still a few tweaks required - a lot of tests are still failing due to setup issues - but its clearly a win as we can now see a clearer picture across the testing landscape.

## Move reference models out of Dogen's repository

For a long time we've been struggling to build Dogen within the hour given to us by Travis. An easy win was to move the reference models ([C++](https://github.com/MASD-Project/cpp_ref_impl) and [C#](https://github.com/MASD-Project/csharp_ref_impl)) away from the main repository. This is also a very logical thing to do as we want these to be examples of stand-alone Dogen products, so that we can point them out to users as an example of how to use the product. Work still remains to be done on the reference implementations (CTest/CDash integration, clean up tests) but the bulk has been done this sprint.

For more details of the work carried out this sprint, see [the sprint log](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/v1/sprint_backlog_09.org).

# User visible changes

Two tiny featurelets were added this sprint:

- **Development Binaries**: We now generate binaries for development releases. These are overwritten with every commit on BinTray.
- **Improvements on ```--version```**: The command now outputs build information to link it back to the build agent and build number. Note that these details are used only for information purposes. We will add GPG signatures in the future to validate the binaries.

# Next Sprint

Infrastructural work will hopefully conclude on the next sprint, but the next big task is getting all the tests to run and pass.

# Binaries

You can download binaries from [Bintray](https://bintray.com/masd-project/main/dogen) for OSX, Linux and Windows (all 64-bit):

- [dogen_1.0.09_amd64-applications.deb](https://dl.bintray.com/masd-project/main/1.0.09/:dogen_1.0.09_amd64-applications.deb)
- [dogen-1.0.09-Darwin-x86_64.dmg](https://dl.bintray.com/masd-project/main/1.0.09/:dogen-1.0.09-Darwin-x86_64.dmg)
- [dogen-1.0.09-Windows-AMD64.msi](https://dl.bintray.com/masd-project/main/:dogen-1.0.09-Windows-AMD64.msi)

For all other architectures and/or operative systems, you will need to build Dogen from source. Source downloads are available below.

Try to see how hard it is to integrate kcov with the current build.

Notes:

- annoyingly, kcov has some binary dependencies rather than being a
  stand alone binary:

: apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev zlib1g-dev libdw-dev libiberty-dev

  as we could not figure out how to install just the SO's in travis,
  we ended up installing the dev packages. These are a lot more than
  what is actually required, but it'll do for now.
- we seem to upload to coveralls, but nothing shows up on the
  site. Try to manually generate coverage first.

*** COMPLETED Add support for code coverage                           :story:
    CLOSED: [2018-10-17 Wed 09:43]

*Rationale*: implemented using kcov.

We started the work on code coverage but never finished it. At present
it seems we don't even have a story detailing the current state of
coverage in the backlog. From memory the problem was that the upload
was too large and the coverage was including lots of files that should
be ignored. We never got the upload to work. In the mean time, it
seems that kcov is a better approach instead of using lcov, gcov, etc.

Links:

- https://github.com/SimonKagstrom/kcov

*Previous understanding*

Finish setting up coveralls

Remaining issues:

- we are generating far too much output. We need to keep it quieter or
  we will break travis.
- we are not filtering out non-project files from initial
  processing. There must be a gcov option to ignore files.

- we should generate coverage from the clang debug build only since
  that is the fastest build we have. We should use the clang coverage
  tool. See [[https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SourceBasedCodeCoverage.html][this document]].

is a major pain because it means we must remember to always push the
tag separately. We need to setup appveyor correctly.

It appears filtering on branches (master only) disables building on
tags. We've now removed this.

Following on from our investigation, we need to add vcpkg to the
travis osx builds (clang). While we're there, update all the tools to
latest in preparation to switching to C++ 17.

Notes:

- it seems its not possible to move to XCode 10 without upgrading the
  OS. This includes the Command Line tools only package as well.
- an alternative is to install the LLVM + clang package supplied by
  the LLVM project. The disadvantage is that we probably also need to
  use this in travis because using two different versions of clang is
  probably not the best idea. We could try and see what happens first,
  but ultimately we'll end up having to install it on travis. The
  binary is 300 MB, which is not ideal but should be ok.
- vcpkg misbehaves a bit when used from clang7. [[https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/issues/4476][Reported]] to
  mothership.

For some reason the badge is gray with the words error. This makes it
less obvious that the build is borked. Fix it so its red.

Seems this is because we are using shields.io rather than the travis
badge.

Actually maybe this is due to the fact that there is currently an
ongoing build. Lets ignore it for now.

We seem to have 50 warnings on both OSX and linux builds, which is a
bit of a coincidence. CTest is probably clipping the warnings.

It is the default. Configured by

Zero is not a good number - it removed all the warnings. Set it to a
large but yet sensible number.

More on debug than release. Some of the warnings are related to
visibility.

Notes:

- setting visibility to hidden does not seem to make any difference.
- we don't seem to have any good answers for this, so we'll leave it
  as is for now.
- this was finally resolved by rebuilding boost with the same

There are quite a few dependencies for this to happen:

- on windows we need to somehow include =/std:c++latest=
- we need to move to latest boost as it seems Boost 1.62 breaks on
  c++-17. We should wait until Beast is included in Boost before we do
  this.
- we need to install latest CMake, which is not available on nuget; so
  we need to fetch the zip/msi from https://cmake.org/files/v3.10/ and
  unpack it. Only latest supports VS 2017. Then set the CMake
  generator:

:    $generator="Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64";

- set the appveyor image:

: image:
:  - Visual Studio 2017

- set the CMake version:

:     set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)

We have now fulfilled all of these requirements, so try to move to
C++17.

When looking at the log files, there are no mentions of C++ 17. Ensure
we are setting this for MSVC.

We are now compiling with C++ 17, but builds are now longer than 1h
and so are getting killed. We will leave it like that and hopefully
find ways of reducing the build time - we are also close to the limit
on Linux as well.

Package went from 5 MB to 80 MB over the last 3 days. The cause for

The problem is we removed =WITH_MINIMAL_PACKAGING= with the move to

Notes:

- we need to add the same level of warnings on GCC so that we can see
  them locally without having to do a windows build, and so that we do
  not introduce regressions.
- it seems we now have the right incantation but the problem is we are
  not picking up the =CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=. This works on all platforms
  but not on windows for some reason. CTest also thinks its a debug
  build, but its not clear CMake does.

Even after offloading all of the test models, we are still breaching
Travis and AppVeyor limits. We need to figure out if we have any
unused types and remove them.

The quickest thing to do is to disable: test data and hashing for all
types in the main models except for =name=.

Since even after removing serialisation from the generation models
(cpp and csharp) we are still quite close to the edge, we need drastic
measures: we need to stop generating test data and serialisation for
all models. Test data was required for testing so we need to comment
out all tests of the generated code. Serialisation was also used for
some tests, though they have probably bit-rotted. We probably should
use serialisation only for round-trip tests and not as a way of
testing components as we did in the past. We should remove all tests
that rely on serialisation, even including dia - it should be replaced
by the XML tool anyway, so no point in paying the cost now. Or perhaps
we can leave dia for last and do all other models.

Problems:

Jot down ideas on the separation between the API and the
implementation in dogen products.

Notes:

- we now have the notion of "distribution channels": UI/UX (wt, qt, gtk
  mobile, etc), DX (swagger, boost asio, library itself).
- the product API should not have any dependencies in terms of storage
  mechanisms; it should have some kind of "model source" interface
  that can then be implemented in terms of the filesystem, GH repo,
  postgres database etc.
- even though it does not make a lot of sense to have a model source
  as part of the remoting API, for consistency reasons we should still
  support it. That is, a code generation end point will merely call
  some internal functions to source the models rather than call
  another endpoint, and users probably don't really need something
  that just reads a model and returns the injector version.
- the distribution channels are a function of the product API.
- according to the [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/][Framework Design Guidelines]], we should design the
  API from scenarios. We should create a specification document that
  can be added to the manual for this.

Architecture vision:

- there are two distinct notions of "generation": 1) code generation as
  users understand it, that is product and component generation, end
  to end; and 2) generation as a part of the pipeline. Since most
  developers are familiar with "codegen", we can use that to signify
  the top-level generation. This means the API should use this term,
  and the high-level orchestrator should have the same name.
- the development model is used by three stages in the pipeline:
  expansion, reduction and generation. We should make the model stand
  alone, containing all of the core modeling elements, and any helpers
  that work only on those types. Then we create models for each
  element in the pipeline; each of these models has an entry point
  which is named after the model (perhaps =expander=, etc). These are
  interfaces by means of DI.
- however one slight snag with this approach is tha the model itself -
  e.g. =expansion::meta_model::model= - is needed as we move from one
  stage to the next; reduction needs to first convert the expansion
  model, generation needs to first convert the reduction model and so
  forth.
- for generation we can use the "template approach", whereby the
  generation element becomes a template.
- following on from FDG, we will from now on name all models:
  ORGANISATION.PRODUCT.COMPONENT, where ORGANISATION is the top-level
  umbrella organisation (e.g. MASD), PRODUCT is the individual product
  (e.g. dogen) and the component is the library or executable.

Enable c++17. - windows requires cpp latest. Then fix inner namespaces
(e.g. =a::b::c=).

We still need to support the old syntax for pre c++-17.

We need to add a new standard to =generator.cpp= and when its set to
c++-17 we should automatically use nested namespaces.

Problems:

- Need to fix boost serialisation:

: namespace boost {
: namespace serialization {

Following on [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/names-of-namespaces][from FDG]], we will from now on name all models:

: ORGANISATION.PRODUCT.COMPONENT

Where ORGANISATION is the top-level umbrella organisation (e.g. MASD),
PRODUCT is the individual product (e.g. dogen) and the component is
the library or executable.

There have been many discussions on this topic, and there are many
pluses and minuses, but one important point is that we need a
consistent approach, and this is as supported by FDG.

We will update the model modules rather than external modules so that
the directory names follow the same naming convention.

We need to update one model at a time.

Now that we are creating a top-level API for Dogen we should really
read up on books about good API design.

Namespacing guideline:

- company | project
- product | technology
- feature
- subnamespace

So in our case, =masd::dogen= and =masd::cpp_ref_impl=. We are
violating the guideline on no abbreviations with ref_impl but
=cpp_reference_implementation= seems a tad long.

It seems we have several types of classes:

- interfaces
- abstract base classes
- values
- objects where data dominates and behaviours are small or trivial
- objects where behaviour dominates and data is small or trivial
- static classes

These should be identifiable at the meta-model level, with appropriate
names.

As per analysis, we need to create a single dogen binary, like so:

: dogen.cli COMMAND COMMAND_SPECIFIC_OPTIONS

Where =COMMAND= is:

- =transform=: functionality that is currently in tailor.
- =generate=: functionality that is currently in knitter.
- =expand=: functionality that is currently in stitcher plus expansion
  of wale templates.
- =make=: functionality in darter: create project, structure etc.

In order to support sub-commands we need to do a lot of hackery with
program options:

- [[https://gist.github.com/randomphrase/10801888][cmdoptions.cpp]]: Demonstration of how to do subcommand option
  processing with boost program_options
- [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15541498/how-to-implement-subcommands-using-boost-program-options][How to implement subcommands using Boost.Program_options?]]

*Merged Stories*

We started off by creating lots of little executables: knitter,
darter, tailor, stitcher. Each of these has its own project,
command-line options etc. However, now that we are concentrating all
of the domain knowledge in yarn, it seems less useful to have so many
executables that are simply calling yarn transforms. Instead, it may
make more sense to use an approach similar to git and have a
"sub-command":

: dogen knit
: dogen tailor

And so forth. Of course, we could also take this opportunity and clean
up these names to making them more meaningful to end users. Perhaps:

: dogen codegen
: dogen transform

Each of these sub-commands or modes would have their own set of
associated options. We need to figure out how this is done using boost
program options. We also need to spend a bit of time working out the
sub-commands to make sure they make sense across the board.

In terms of names, we can't really call the project "dogen". We should
call it something allusive to the command line, such as cli. However,
the final binary should be called dogen or perhaps, =dogen.cli=. This
fits in with other binaries such as =dogen.web=, =dogen.http=,
=dogen.gui= etc.

Now we've designed a clean top-level API for the product, we need to
code-generate it and implement it in terms of the existing code.

Notes:

- given the new ideas around creating a lib for all binaries - so we do
  not have to have huge amounts of hackery when testing some aspects
  of an executable - we require a new convention for naming the cmake
  targets. There are some constraints:
  - we cannot have dots in the target name because some build systems
    do not support them (=make=, it seems). Strangely enough we do
    seem to have targets with dots at present:

: set(name "annotations")
: set(tests_name "${name}.tests")
: add_executable(${tests_name} ${files})

    Maybe this works because we do not reference this target? OK this
    was tested and no problems were spotted. We need to send this
    change to the build farm and see if anything breaks across the
    platforms.

  - we need to distinguish between the library and the executable for
    executables. For example, we have =masd.dogen.cli=; whilst cmake
    correctly names the binaries =libmasd.dogen.cli= and
    =masd.dogen.cli=, the targets themselves have the same name
    (=masd.dogen.cli=).
  - at present we are using the simple name for a model as the cmake
    target name; this means that we cannot have two models with the
    same simple name but different external/model modules. To be fair,
    this seems like a really unlikely scenario. By sheer luck , we do
    not have any problems for the product API model because the
    product name is the model name (e.g. =masd.dogen= becomes
    =dogen=).
- one possible solution is to say that on the exceptional case of
  binaries, we need to use the postfix =_lib= and =_exe= for the
  targets, e.g. =cli_lib= and =cli_exe=. For all other cases we can
  maintain the existing rule.

*** POSTPONED Clean up the mess of refactors in dogen core            :story:

We finally found a good model for the data in dogen, and its based on
data driven design. Basically, we need to let go of OOP constructs
that aggregate data that is logically related from a human perspective
and start to think of data usage patterns. From this perspective,
there is no such thing as a modeling element - just a scattering of
properties that are used by different transforms all the way into text
transformation. Even text transforms don't really operate on
elements - they operate on specific element properties. If we segment
the text transforms this way, we end up with a large number of small
text transforms, each with very specific tasks, generating chunks of a
file. Finally, at the end, we need to concatenate these chunks to form
the end product. With this approach we solve the impedance mismatch
between the modeling model and the generational model - all we now
have are additional containers with properties. This also means that
its much easier to have different models further down the pipeline
because they are just adding more properties. We can even use
inheritance for this, e.g. generational model inherits from modeling
model and adds properties x, y, z; generational cpp model inherits
from generational model and so forth. As an example, instead of
generating the decoration properties for every artefact, we now split
all elements into two groups: those that have "standard" decoration
properties and those that have overriden decoration properties. We
then generate these two groups. For those sharing the common
decoration properties, we insert those in their vector X times. This
is still not the most efficient (we really only need one copy) but its
orders of magnitude (at least one) faster than the current
approach. Similarly with namespaces: we only need to do the namespaces
once for all types in a facet.

However, we are very far from this at present. The first task is to
try to abort the OOP refactors that we made in the past.

*** CANCELLED Rename options to transformation request                :story:
    CLOSED: [2018-10-19 Fri 14:54]

*Rationale*: this will be cleaned up as part of the work on the
product API.

These are not really "options"; it is a request made into yarn to
code-generate a model. We haven't yet got a proper name but it has to
somehow involve the word "request". The best way is to visualise this
as part of some API where may such requests can be made (and handled
concurrently).

This also means we need to split out the request from the context. We
should have an initialisation phase where we construct the context and
then we should be able to reuse the pipeline for many requests. This
also means that the right place to put the transform metrics is in the
request - not the context - given that these are request specific.

The best way to go about it may be to have two contexts:

- transformation context: const; loaded at start-up.
- request context: request specific context, including probing and the
  request itself.

Then:

- clients are responsible for setting up the transformation
  context. This ensures we do it only once.
- clients are also responsible for setting up the request context, but
  they then do it for each request.

Note also that a request should support multiple target models.
