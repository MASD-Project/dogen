***** Introduction

Welcome to the first release of Dogen under quarantine. I hope you
have been able to stay home and stay safe, in what are very trying
times for us all. This release is obviously unimportant in the grand
scheme of things, but perhaps it can provide a momentary respite to
those of us searching for /something else/ to focus our attention
on. The sprint itself was a rather positive one, if somewhat quiet on
the user-facing front; of particular note is the fact that we have
/finally/ made major inroads on the fabled "generation" refactoring,
which we shall cover at length. So get ready for some geeky [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_engineering][MDE]]
stories.

***** User Visible Changes

This section covers stories that affect end users, with the video
providing a quick demonstration of the new features, and the sections
below describing them in more detail. Since there were only a couple
of minor user facing changes, we've used the video to chat about the
internal work as well.

******* Generate the MASD Palette

Whilst positive from an end-goal perspective, the growth of the
=logical= model has had a big impact on the MASD palette, and we soon
started to struggle to find colours for this zoo of new meta-model
elements. Predictably, the more the model grew, the bigger the problem
became and the direction of travel was more of the same. We don't have
a lot of time for artistic reveries, so this sprint we felt enough's
enough and took the first steps in automating the process. To our
great astonishment, even something as deceptively simple as "finding
decent colours" is a [[https://seaborn.pydata.org/introduction.html][non-trivial question]], for which there is
published research. So we followed Voltaire's sound advice - /le mieux
est l'ennemi du bien/ and all that - and went for the simplest
possible approach that could get us moving in the right direction.

#+caption: Old MASD palette

/Figure 1: Fragment of the old MASD palette, with manually crafted colours./

A [[https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/blob/master/projects/dogen.dia/python/generate_colours.py][trivial new script]] to generate colours was created. It is based on
the above-linked [[https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html][Seaborn python library]], as it appears to provide sets
of palettes for these kinds of use cases. We are yet to master the
technicalities of the library, but at this point we can at least
generate groups of colours that are vaguely related. This is clearly
only the beginning of the process, both in terms of joining the dots
of the scripts (at present you need to manually copy the new palettes
into the colouring script) but also as far as finding the right
Seaborn palettes to use; as you can see from Figure 2, the new MASD
palette has far too many similar colours, making it difficult to
visually differentiate meta-model elements. More exploration of
Seaborn - and colouring in general - is required.

******  Add =org-mode= output to  =dumpspecs=

The [[https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/releases/tag/v1.0.22][previous sprint]] saw the addition of a new command to the Dogen
command line tool called =dumpspecs=:

#+begin_example
$ ./dogen.cli --help | tail -n 7
Commands:

   generate       Generates source code from input models.
   convert        Converts a model from one codec to another.
   dumpspecs      Dumps all specs for Dogen.

For command specific options, type <command> --help.
#+end_example

At inception,=dumpspecs= only supported the =plain= reporting style,
but it became obvious that it could also benefit from providing
=org-mode= output. For this, a new command line option was added:
=--reporting-style=.

#+begin_example
$ ./dogen.cli dumpspecs --help
Dogen is a Model Driven Engineering tool that processes models encoded in supported codecs.
Dogen is created by the MASD project.
Displaying options specific to the dumpspecs command.
For global options, type --help.

Dumping specs:
  --reporting-style arg Format to use for dumping specs. Valid values: plain,
                        org-mode. Defaults to org-mode.
#+end_example

The output can be saved to a file for visualisation and further processing:

#+begin_example
$ ./dogen.cli dumpspecs --reporting-style org-mode > specs.org
#+end_example

The resulting file can be opened on any editor that supports
=org-mode=, such as [[https://orgmode.org/][Emacs]], [[https://github.com/jceb/vim-orgmode][Vim]] or [[https://vscode-org-mode.github.io/vscode-org-mode][Visual Studio Code]]. Figure 3
provides an example of visualising the output in Emacs.

*****  Development Matters

This section cover topics that are mainly of interest if you follow
Dogen development, such as details on internal stories that consumed
significant resources, important events, etc. As usual, if you are
interested on all the gory details of the work carried out this
sprint, please see the [[https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/v1/sprint_backlog_23.org][sprint log]].

******  Milestones

The 11,000th commit was made to the Dogen GitHub repository during
this release.

/Figure 4: 11,000th commit for Dogen on GitHub./

The Dogen build is now completely warning and error free, across all
supported configurations - pleasing to the eye for the OCD'ers amongst
us. Of course, now the valgrind defects on the nightly become even
more visible, so we'll have to sort those out soon.

******  Significant Internal Stories

The sprint was dominated by smattering of small and medium-sized
stories that, collectively, made up the "generation" refactor
work. We've grouped the most significant of them into a handful of
"themes", allowing us to cover the refactor in some detail. To be
fair, it is difficult to provide all of the required context in order
to fully understand the rationale for the work, but we tried our best.

*******  Rename =assets= to the =logical= model

One change that was trivial with regards to resourcing but huge in
conceptual terms was the rename of =assets= into the =logical=
model. We'll talk more about the importance of this change in the next
section - in the context of the logical-physical space - but here I
just want to reflect a little on the historic evolution of this model,
as depicted on Table 1.

/Table 1: Historic evolution of the name of the model with the core Dogen entities./

What this cadence of name changes reveals is a desperate hunt to
understand the role of this model in the domain. We are now hoping
that it has reached its final resting place, but we'll only know for
sure when we complete the write up of the MASD conceptual model.

******* Towards a =physical= Model

The processing pipeline for Dogen remains largely unchanged since its
early days. Figure 6 is a diagram from [[https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/releases/tag/v1.0.12][sprint 12]] describing the
pipeline and associated models; other than new names, it is largely
applicable to the code as it stands today. However, as we've already
hinted, what has changed in quite dramatic fashion is our
understanding of the /conceptual role/ of these models. Over time, a
picture of a sparse /logical-physical/ space emerged; as elements
travel through the pipeline, they are also traveling through this
space, transformed by projections that are parameterised by
variability, and ultimately materializing as fully-formed artefacts,
ready to be written to the filesystem. Beneath those small name
changes lies a leap in conceptual understanding of the domain, and
posts such as the [[https://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/2018/01/nerd-food-refactoring-quagmire.html][The Refactoring Quagmire]] give you a feel for just
how long and windy the road to enlightenment has been.

#+caption: Processing pipeline
[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MASD-Project/dogen/master/doc/blog/images/orchestration_pipeline.png]]

/Figure 6: Dogen's processing pipeline circa sprint 12./

For the last few sprints, we have been trying to get the code to
behave according to this newly found knowledge. The [[https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/releases/tag/v1.0.22][previous sprint]]
saw us transition the =variability= model to this brave new world, and
this sprint we have turned our attention to the =logical= and
=physical= models. Whilst the =logical= model work was just a trivial
rename (narrated above), the =physical= model was a much bigger task
than any thus far because all we had was an assortment of unrelated
models, very far away from their desired state.

Our starting salvo was composed of three distinct lines of attack:

- *Refactor the =archetypes= /modelet/*. The first moment of
  enlightenment was when we realised that the small =archetypes= model
  was nothing but a disguised meta-model of the physical dimension for
  the logical-physical space. In effect, it is a /metaphysical/ model
  though such a name (and associated pun) would probably not be viewed
  well in academic circles, so we had to refrain from using
  it. Nonetheless, we took the existing =archetypes= model and
  refactored it into the core of the =physical= model. Types such as
  =archetype_location= became the basis of the physical meta-model,
  populated with entities such as =backend=, =facet= and =kernel=.
- *Merge the =extraction= model into the =physical= model*. More
  surprisingly, we eventually realised that the =extraction= model was
  actually representing /instances/ of the physical meta-model, and as
  such should be merged into it. It was rather difficult to wrap our
  heads around this concept; to do so, we had to let go of the idea
  that =artefacts= are representations of files in memory, and instead
  started to view them as elements travelling in the logical-physical
  space towards their ultimate destination. After a great many
  whiteboard sessions, these ideas were eventually clarified and then
  much of the conceptual design fell into place.
- *Move physical aspects in the =logical= model to the =physical=
  model*. The last step of our three-pronged approach was to figure
  out that the proliferation of types with names such as
  =artefact_properties=, =enablement_properties= and the like was just
  a leakage of physical concepts into the logical model. This happened
  because we did not have a strong conceptual framework, and so never
  quite knew where to place things. As the physical model started to
  take shape with the two changes above, we finally resolved this long
  standing problem, and it suddenly became clear that most of the
  physical properties we had been associating with logical elements
  were more adequately modeled as /part of the artefacts
  themselves/. This then allows us to cleanly separate the =logical=
  and =physical= models, very much in keeping with the decoupling
  performed [[https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/releases/tag/v1.0.22][last sprint]] for the =variability= and =physical= models
  (the latter known then as =archetypes=, of course). The sprint saw
  us modeling the required types correctly in the =physical= model,
  but the entire tidy-up will be long in completing as the code in
  question is very fiddly.

#+caption: Physical Model
[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MASD-Project/dogen/master/doc/blog/images/dogen_physical_model.png]]

/Figure 7: Entities in the =physical= model./

Once all of these changes were in, we ended up with a =physical= model
with a more coherent look and feel, as Figure 7 atestares. However, we
were not quite done. We then turned our attention to one of the
biggest challenges within the physical model. For reasons that have
been lost in the mists of time, very early on in Dogen's life we
decided that all names within a location /had to be qualified/. This
is best illustrated by means of an example. Take the archetype
=masd.cpp.types.class_header=, responsible for creating header files
for classes. Its physical location was previously as follows:

- kernel: =masd=
- backend: =masd.cpp=
- facet: =masd.cpp.types=
- archetype: =masd.cpp.types.class_header=

This was a /remarkably bad idea/, with all sorts of consequences and
none of them good - not least of which complicating things
significantly when trying to come up with a unified approach to file
paths processing. So we had to very carefully change the code to use
simple names as it should have done in the first place, /i.e./:

- kernel: =masd=
- backend: =cpp=
- facet: =types=
- archetype: =class_header=

Because /so much/ of the code base depended on the fully qualified
name - think formatter registrations, binding of logical model
elements, etc - it was an uphill battle to get it to comply with this
change. In fact, it was /by far/ the most expensive story of the
entire sprint. Fortunately we have tests that give us some modicum of
confidence that we have not broken the world when making such
fundamental changes, but nonetheless it was grueling work.

******* Rename the =generation= Models to =m2t=

It has long been understood that "formatters" are nothing but
model-to-text (M2T) transforms, as per standard [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_engineering][MDE]] terminology. With
this sprint, we finally had the time to rename the generation models
to their rightful name:

- =generation= became =m2t=
- =generation.cpp= became =m2t.cpp=
- =generation.csharp= became =m2t.csharp=

In addition, as per the previous story, the new role of the =m2t=
model is now to perform the expansion of the logical model into the
physical dimension of the logical-physical space. With this sprint we
begun this exercise, but sadly only scratched the surface as we ran
out of time. Nonetheless, the direction of travel seems clear, and
much of the code that is at present duplicated between =m2t.cpp= and
=m2t.csharp= should find its new home within =m2t=, in a generalised
form that makes use of the shiny new =physical= meta-model.

******* Rename the =meta-model= Namespace to =entities=

One of the terms that can become very confusing very fast is
=meta-model=. When you are thick in the domain of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_engineering][MDE]], pretty much
everything you touch is a meta-something, so much so that calling
things "meta-models" should be done sparingly and only when it can
provide some form of enlightenment to the reader. So it was that we
decided to deprecate the widely used namespace =meta-model= in favour
of the much blander =entities=.

******* Resourcing

With an astonishing utilisation rate of 66%, this sprint was extremely
efficient. Perhaps a tad /too/ efficient, even; next sprint we may
need to lower the utilisation rate back closer to 50%, in order to
ensure we get adequate rest. We've also managed to focus 80% of the
total ask on stories directly related to the sprint mission. Of these,
the flattening of the physical names completely dominated the work
(over 25%), followed by a smattering of smaller stories. Outside of
the sprint's mission, we spent a bit over 17% on process, with 10% on
release notes and demo - still a tad high, but manageable - and the
rest on maintaining the sprint and product backlog. The small crumbs
were spent on "vanity" infrastructure projects: adding support for
clang 10 (1%) - which brought noticeable benefits because =clangd=, as
always, has improved in leaps and bounds - and sorting out some rather
annoying warnings on Windows' =clang-cl= (1.3%).

****** Roadmap

We've updated the roadmap with the big themes we envision as being key
to the release of Dogen v2. As always, it must be taken with a huge
grain of salt, but still there is something very satisfying about
seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.

*Note:* The OSX and Linux binaries are not stripped at present and so
are larger than they should be. We have [[https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/product_backlog.org#linux-and-osx-binaries-are-not-stripped][an outstanding story]] to
address this issue, but sadly CMake does not make this a trivial
undertaking.

*****  Next Sprint

We shall continue work on the "generation" refactor - a name that is
now not quite as apt given all the model renaming. We are hopeful -
but not _too_ hopeful - of completing this work next sprint. Famous
last words.

That's all for this release. Happy Modeling!

We need to move the types in generation model related to enablement
into the physical model. We also need to move the types in the logical
model related to enablement into the physical model. We need to create
the enablement transform in the physical model. These are then called
from the generation model.

Notes:

- split enablement features by facet, backend, kernel etc.
- add code generation support for static configuration on templates.
- our current logic for enablement is far too complex. We can simplify
  it quite a lot with a few small changes:

  - logical types which cannot be generated should be removed prior to
    physical expansion.
  - disabled backend should be detected before any work is carried
    out. The cost should be very close to zero. We don't need to do
    any checks for this afterwards.
  - disabled facets (remember these can only be done globally) and
    globally disabled archetypes should result in these formatters
    being removed from the set of generatable formatters and not
    taking any part on the physical expansion at all.

  Therefore, by the time we are computing enablement, it is, by
  definition, only a local concern. All other global cases have
  already been handled. Then, we can simply go through the expanded
  archetypes and check local enablement.
- another thing we could do as well is to remove all of the disabled
  archetypes from the physical model. Therefore enablement is not even
  a boolean but its determined by existence (i.e. if you exist you are
  enabled). This may be a bit too radical, but we can at least prune
  any artefacts which are not enabled post-enablement transform.
- if we take this to its logical conclusion, perhaps formatters are
  not "global" at all. Perhaps we should check the pool of available
  formatters at the very start of processing and then immediately read
  the enablement status of the archetypes - this can be part of the
  physical meta-model - and then only work on the archetypes that are
  enabled. This includes template instantiation as well. However, we
  need to be careful that this is all done within some kind of
  context. If the library processes two requests, they should both
  work even though one may be for C++ and the other for C#. Therefore
  we need to be careful on how we are creating the context. In
  summary: global enablement (backend, facet, archetype) is part of
  the physical meta-model transforms. It should execute when creating
  the context. Anything which is disabled should be removed.
- at present we are instantiating the =enabled= feature across the
  entire =masd= template instantiation domain. This is a very
  "efficient" way to do it because we only define one
  feature. However, it also means its now possible to disable a facet
  or backend at the element level. And worse, the binding point is
  global:

: #DOGEN masd.variability.default_binding_point=any
: #DOGEN masd.variability.generate_static_configuration=false
: #DOGEN masd.variability.instantiation_domain_name=masd

  The right thing to do is to create four separate features, one for
  the backend, one for the features and one for the archetype
  (global). Then another one for the archetype, locally. Each with the
  correct binding point.
- actually this approach of removing formatters won't work. The
  problem is most of our use cases are as follows:

  1. disable facet F0 globally (e.g. hash)
  2. enable facet only for a few elements that need it (call it e0)
  3. manually determine the relationship graph G of e0 so that all
     elements of G are also enabled.

  Were we to remove F0's formatters on step 1, this use case would
  break.
- the physical meta-model must also express static dependencies
  between archetypes. That is, for a given archetype we must declare
  what archetypes it depends on.
- there are four levels of enablement transforms:

  1. Physical meta-model (PMM). Read meta-data to determine what is
     enabled or disabled for this model globally (backend, facet,
     archetype.
  2. PMM solving. Take into account dependencies. Simple solving
     (e.g. requested =hash= but =types= is disabled). User can supply
     a flag: =--fix-unsatisfiability=. This decides whether to break
     on unsatisfiability or fix unsatisfiability.
  3. Physical model (PM). Read meta-data to determine what is enabled
     locally for this model (archetype). Use global data to determine
     state of the artefact.
  4. PM solving. Take into account both element level enablement as
     well as the relationships between elements to solve
     enablement. =--fix-unsatisfiability= also applies.
- actually, one mistake we made was to generate dependencies over the
  logical model. At present we have a function on each formatter that
  determines the includes. This is the wrong way of doing things. We
  should transform the dependencies at the logical model level into
  dependencies at the physical model level, adequately classified
  according to dependency type. For this we can rely on the same
  approach (e.g. =inclusion_dependencies=) but instead of creating
  inclusion dependencies, we are just creating dependencies. These
  dependencies then have multiple uses:

  - enablement solving: either via multiple passes, a DAG or SATs.
  - for C/C++: inclusion files.
  - for C#: usings. we need to capture model and namespace level
    dependencies; that is, we need a container that takes into account
    only unique module paths (across all module paths).

  Now the inclusion transform will be very simple. We just need to
  create relative paths - relative to a well-known part, and that's ok
  because we are inside the major technical space so we can hard-code
  the part - for each dependency, according to the dependency
  types. We need to figure out if the transform should be inside of
  the TS or not. Probably should because its TS specific.

Tasks:

- split out enablement features.
- add enabled attributes for all PMM elements.
- add enablement transform for the PMM that reads global enablement.
- change template instantiation code to use the physical meta-model.
- add enablement transform for the PM that uses the
- add a generatable flag in logical model elements with associated
  transform.
- add a pruning transform that filters out all non-generatable types
  from logical model.

Merged stories:

*Refactor enablement types*

These types all have historical names.

Tasks:

- =local_archetype_location_properties=: these are just enablement
  properties. We need to also add =backend_enabled=, at which point
  the type in the logical model is identical to the one in the
  generation model.
- =global_archetype_location_properties=: with the exception of
  =denormalised_archetype_properties=, these types are just used to
  read the meta-data for enablement. They could be private to a helper
  that generates =enablement_properties= and could be used for both
  global and local.
- the enablement transform (probably) has no dependencies and could be
  lifted into the physical model.

*Rationale*: this story is too broad. There are many dependencies in
order to be able to achieve this. Best to create small and focused
stories for each of these.

Now that we understand the role of the physical model, we need to get
rid of all the failed attempts at representing physical data across
other models such as the logical model, =m2t= etc. We need to use the
artefact itself and supply it to the formatters.

Notes:

- these attributes need to be migrated from the logical model into the
  physical model:
  - artefact level: artefact_properties, enablement_properties
  - model level: extraction_properties
- we need to understand what the pair =element_archetype= does. If
  necessary, it needs to be moved to the physical model or to the
  logical/physical mapping (see also =enabled_archetype_for_element=
  set).
- at present we are creating new artefacts in the workflows. We need
  to copy them across from =m2t=.
- at present we are expanding the physical model without regards for
  enablement. This means that we generate a lot of artefacts that are
  not going to be used. We then added a number of hacks to filter
  those out. The right solution would be to have enablement done just
  after expansion, and then remove all artefacts that are not
  enabled. We could add a "prune" transform for this. This needs to be
  done after enablement is moved to the physical model.

At present we are checking the validity of dynamic stereotypes for
only a number of logical model elements: those for which we expect to
have dynamic stereotypes. The problem is, we can add stereotypes by
mistake to other model elements - or worse, we can make a typo on a
static stereotype and then the model will silently ignore it. We need
to throw whenever a stereotype appears where it shouldn't be.

This was spotted by adding the following to a package:

: masd::physical::facets

Typo on "facets".

*** COMPLETED Generative models                                        :epic:
    CLOSED: [2020-04-17 Fri 09:11]

*Rationale*: the latest physical model approach solves all of the
problems highlighted in this story in a way that is consistent with
the conceptual model. However we probably should add "generative" to
model kinds once that is implemented.

We started by conflating two very different kinds of models:

- models that generate models
- models that generate code for the end user.

These models appeared similar because we needed to generate some
"helper types" in order to perform the generative parts; we had things
like fabric, formattables and so forth. However, now that we have
started to remove all of the helper parts, the main thing that is left
in generative models is just the formatters. Another way of thinking
about this problem is to imagine that a generative model could
register what it offers:

- the dominant technical space;
- all of the available facets;
- all of the available formatters;
- all aspects within each formatter.

Then, from a non-generative model - assuming some kind of plugin
mechanism which would load the generative models - we could then make
use of all that was defined in the generative model. In order for this
to work (and assuming all classes for technical spaces, etc exist),
the code generator would have to generate all of the infrastructure
needed for a generative model:

- some kind of top-level transform (e.g. "model to extraction model
  transform"), and associated machinery to register the transform.
- stereotypes to declare facets and formatters. The formatter elements
  need to have a meta-model element as meta-data.
- for the first generation, we'd use wale templates to initialise the
  stitch templates for each element. Once these exist, we'd simply
  expand them.

We need to decide if the generative model is still in the same space
as the non-generative model, or if it exists on a separate
dimension. If it is in the same space, then facets, etc will come out
of types. We could easily suppress IO, hashing etc as required. The
advantage of this approach is that we can now mix non-generative types
with generative types, so that we could provide helper classes etc
easily. However, the folder structure will be confusing; this is
exactly the current problem we have with say generation.cpp, with
folders like =types/formaters/types= and the like. In this case, we'd
have =types/types=, =types/hash= and so forth.

The other downside is the current approach where we need to associate
a "formatter style" with the model element and facet (e.g. stitch,
stock, etc). However, as we do at present, we can perform the
association via profiles, so that users need not be aware of this
mapping. Nonetheless, its good to force users to declare up front if
they are creating a generative model so that there are no
surprises. In fact, a much better way to handle this is to create
different meta-model elements to represent these entities: facet,
formatter etc. These then bind to the wale and stitch templates rather
than to c++ code. This then means that the formatting style now
becomes bound at the meta-model level rather than allowing users to
manually bind it (likely causing hard to debug problems). In addition,
we should make it so that all meta-model elements that are not
code-generated can have a wale template associated. This means that
stitch is no longer special. It also means that "overwrite" may not be
a good name for the flag that determines if something is hand-crafted
or not. Check for stories on this flag.

Variations:

- additive generative model: we want to add facets to an existing
  technical space.
- new generative model: we want to create a new technical space.

Notes:

- the generative models are always going to generate C++ code.
- once we have support for products, we could create a product type of
  "dogen plugin", which generates all of the infrastructure to make
  the plugin (e.g. vcpkg to fetch dogen headers, etc). This could even
  include the targets that call dogen, registering the plugin and
  generating the "test models" - i.e. models created by the user to
  exercise the generative model.
- this approach closely mirrors the injection model. If we call these
  "extractors" we could have a registrar against the technical space
  which produces the extraction model. The only difference is that we
  need access to the generation model in order to call the
  extractor. This makes it unsuitable to live in the extraction model
  itself.
- once we are able to generate annotations machinery, the creation of
  aspects will be easy; we can just bind against the annotation and
  extract the configuration.
- note that we have two uses for meta-model elements such as technical
  space, facet etc. The first use is as a "validator". They bind to
  the configuration of the model, so if there are no generators
  exporting the expected values for these meta-model elements,
  generation will fail. The second role is generative; if the user
  declared a facet in the target model, we will then project the facet
  through the types facet for facets and generate the code needed to
  register the facet as part of a generative model (a
  generator). Similarly with all other types such as formatters,
  technical spaces etc. We can look at the "generatable" flag to
  determine if generation is needed or not. We need to make sure that
  when we inject these, they are marked as non-generatable. Problem:
  what happens when you are generating the generating model for a
  technical space? There is a conflict; we will add the same facets,
  technical spaces etc twice: once from the model itself and then a
  second time from the generator. We need to somehow split these two
  roles into different meta-model elements to make it really clear
  they represent different roles. In fact, from the perspective of
  registration/checks, we could even argue that these are no longer
  meta-model elements - the point of the meta-model is to generate
  code. By the same token, elements such as decoration would also be
  incongruent though. We need to make sure we do not create a loop
  when we are changing an existing generator, whereby we can no longer
  generate code because the new state is not valid.

As spotted by Ian and Indranil, the default constructor of primitives
should be generated when these are built-in types. At present we are
always relying on compiler supplied default constructors. We already
have code for this in object so we can copy and paste it to the
primitive.

Valgrind is complaining about this in the reference model:

Whilst we wanted to first generate the files manually for the physical
entities, it seems it may even be easier to start immediately by
code-generating these entities. The rational is that it helps to think
of the entire problem in one go rather than try to evolve it so that
we can address several problems at once.

The moment of enlightenment came when we started to visualise physical
entities projected across multiple archetypes:

- the element definition. This is a simple factory that creates a
  backend, facet or archetype.
- the model-to-text transform. For backends and formatters, and
  possibly even for facets too; once all the interfaces have been
  worked out, the role of the transform will be well-defined;
  something like the backend calls all facets and the facets calls all
  formatters; they return a list of artefacts. We need to define both
  the header file (perhaps without wale being required since we can
  code-generate the header) and the implementation.
- the stitch template. If it doesn't exist, creates a "template
  skeleton". If it exists, it will be setup to generate the class
  implementation.

Note that we are not providing a generic solution for stitch
templates; they are hard-coded by the logical meta-model element to do
one thing, which is to generate the implementation. Similarly for wale
templates (if needed, but we don't think they are). More generally,
the entire structure is completely hard-coded _by design_. In
addition, the fact that we map both backends and facets to UML
packages is a mere "artefact" of the representation. The key thing is
that these are /containers/. Finally, note that we can easily generate
code that retrieves all facets and archetypes from a backend - during
logical model transformation we can figure out containment and
determine what belongs where. The logical model entities for the
physical elements should contain the logical names of these entities.

There is no difference between this approach and what we have done for
variability. This is designed as a hard-coded approach for this
specific problem; it will not have any use whatsoever outside of
Dogen.

Note also that the model-to-text interface will only retrieve the
components of the PMM; we still need an assembly transform.

We need to be very clear here on what constitutes multiple archetypes
vs multiple logical elements. For example:

- a visitor is not a projection of a base class logical element. This
  is because the visitor really should be its own entity at the
  logical model level, and we may want to reference it within the
  logical model.
- the static factory of backend has to be seen as a projection of the
  backend logical element. We need to provide a good rationale for why
  this is different from the visitor in order to ensure the conceptual
  model remains consistent. Intuitively we are trying to say that
  these elements are instantiating physical meta-model elements. The
  easiest way is not to make a factory but instead use a factory
  method.
- we need to declare backend and facet as containers, and follow the
  existing pattern. This is not brilliant because we then need to do a
  second look-up to figure out the types of the contained elements,
  but at least the design is consistent. If we invent another
  containment approach its going to be difficult to remember how it
  works.

Notes:

- followed all the steps in [[file:sprint_backlog_21.org::*How to add new meta-model elements][sprint 21]] for adding new elements, the
  only thing missing is adding the formatters.
- simple containment rules: facets must be contained in a backend
  (e.g. the containing namespace) and archetypes must be contained in
  a facet. If we cannot find the containing element, we throw. The
  containing is determined as we already do for modules. This code
  needs to be factored out into a helper. Name factory is a good
  candidate.
- at present we are generating modules when we can't find them. We now
  need to check on all containers before we create the module (modules
  transform).
- we are still missing the adaption of attributes for both archetype
  kinds and parts.
- we need to add a collection of all meta-names to the model and use
  it to validate the logical model element id. It can be populated on
  the meta-naming transform.
- meta-naming transform must move to pre-assembly stage. Actually this
  won't work due to dependencies. Instead we have to rely on the
  post-assembly validator.
- we need to bootstrap the generation of archetypes. First we need to
  generate them using the old machinery. We need to do this with a
  "old" and a "new" version of archetypes. We won't plug in the new
  until they are generating exactly the same code as the old. Then we
  delete the old, rename the new and plug them in.
- at present all formatters are generating files with the same
  name. This is because we copied the header file for forward
  declarations for all three. So when we change one formatter, the
  others could possibly overwrite the contents. This was not a problem
  before because they were all the same. However, what is not clear is
  why it works for the code generator itself but not for the
  tests. But a quick way to find out is to fix the paths so that we
  generate three different files.
- we need to create a helper to generate stitch templates. This could
  be part of stitch itself (template builder?). The template builder
  takes in a stream and executes commands on it. Or perhaps it just
  returns a string in the correct shape?
- we incorrectly thought we needed a CPP formatter. In reality, the
  stitch formatter is responsible for the following things:

  - if the template does not yet exist, create a template for it.
  - if it exists, load it.
  - mark the artefact as requiring /post-processing/ with stitch.

  Then we can loop through all the artefacts, find those needing
  stitch post-processing and apply the stitch formatter to them. Note
  that are two very distinct stitch formatters:

  - the one that generates templates or loads them;
  - the one that transforms them into C++ code.

  This can all work in parallel with existing code; artefacts will
  default to "invalid" post-processing. Or we can set them to
  "none". We then filter those set to "stitch". In the future we can
  have other types of post-processing (e.g. ODB).
- we need to add the new workflow to post-process artefacts. We can
  try to add it in the =m2t= model as a transform and see what breaks.
- actually its not entirely accurate to remove the formatter for the
  implementation. It is true that we do not have a formatter, but we
  still need to populate the physical space with the representation of
  the archetype. In addition the notion of "post-processing" is
  slightly misleading: we are just saying that there are formatter
  dependencies more than anything else. Besides we will have archetype
  dependencies sooner or later. We can do this in two passes:

  - for now, ignore dependencies. You need to generate twice if you
    add a new formatter. After that it will just work.
  - in the future, add a dag for the physical model and make sure
    generation is done via a DFS of that DAG. Create archetype
    dependencies to build the DAG.
- however, one slightly disconcerting problem with this approach is
  that we are still lying at the interface level. We are saying that
  our inputs are the logical element and the current state of the
  artefact. We are omitting the fact that we are loading another
  artefact from the filesystem. This is not great. If for example we
  were running using a different storage mechanism this would not
  work. We should explicitly supply the input artefact. So for this we
  need two things: the dependency between artefacts and the notion
  that some formatters have a set of artefacts as inputs. One possible
  way to map this to the existing conceptual model is to imagine some
  kind of "composite formatters". This then also bumps into the
  cartridge story. To recap, up to know we had the behaviour that one
  formatter was associated with one model element and generated one
  artefact. With cartridges this is no longer true; ODB can generate N
  artefacts. In addition, we need to use another artefact as
  input. However we do know what N is upfront and we do want the shape
  of physical space to take into account these new files. We just need
  to solve the impedance mismatch. This can be achieved by somehow
  "tagging" the input and output artefacts and then creating a
  "composite formatter" that receives all of the artefacts tagged as
  input and output as its arguments (rather than a single input/output
  artefact). Then the cartridge can use the temp directory idea
  explained above to generate the files and populate each artefact
  with the contents. The filenames must match. The ODB configuration
  could be a meta-model element (or it could be part of a profile) but
  it will not be directly related to this formatter. Its likely that
  we don't even need the logical element for this formatter. When we
  are expanding the logical model, we could immediately classify the
  artefacts into those that are tagged and those that are not. Then we
  just loop through them.
- actually we don't even need any form of tagging: the dependencies
  will tell us. We just need different types of dependencies: input,
  output, input/output. We need a notion of a formatter with a
  "different" kind of archetype which does not itself generate an
  artefact. This is where having post-processing formatters would
  really help because they could be "different".

Merged stories:

*Formatter meta-model elements*

A second approach is to leave this work until we have a way to code
generate meta-model elements. Then we could have a way to supply this
information as meta-data - or perhaps it is derived from the position
of the element in modeling space? The key thing is we need a static
method to determine the meta-name, and a virtual method to allow
access to it via inheritance. Perhaps we need to capture this pattern
in a more generic way. It may even already exist in the patterns
book. Then the elements would become an instance of the pattern. We
should also validate that all descendants provide a value for this
argument (e.g. an element descendant must have the meta-name set). We
could also use this for stereotypes.

The binding of the formatter against the meta-type is interesting, in
this light. The formatter has a type parameter - the type it is
formatting. In fact the formatter may have a number of type
parameters - we need to look at the stitch templates to itemise them
all - and these are then used to generate the formatter's template. We
could take this a level up and say that, at least conceptually, there
is a meta-meta-type for formatters, which is made up of a
parameterisable type. Then we could declare the formatter as an
instance of this meta-meta-type with a well-defined set of
parameters. Then, when a user instantiates a formatter, we can check
that all of the mandatory parameters have been filled in and error if
not. In this case we have something like:

- =masd::structural::parameterisable_type=. This is a meta-type that
  has a list of KVPs. Some are mandatory, some are optional.
- =masd::codegen::meta_formatter=. This defines the parameters needed
  for the formatter, with default values etc.
- =masd::codegen::formatter=. This is the actual formatters. They must
  supply values for the parameters defined by the meta-formatter.

Of course, we do not need a three-level hierarchy for this, and if
this is the only case where these parameters are used, we could just
hard-code the formatter as a meta-element and treat it like we do with
all other meta-types. Interestingly, we could bind formatters to
stereotypes rather than meta-elements. This would allow us to avoid
binding into the dogen implementation, and instead think at the MASD
level (e.g. =dogen::assets::meta_model::structural::enumeration= is a
lot less elegant than =masd::enumeration= or even
=masd::structural::enumeration=).

We could also validate that the wale template exists. In fact, if the
wale template is a meta-model element, we can check for consistency
within resolution. However, we need a generic way to associate a wale
template with any facet. The ideal setup would be for users to define
wale templates as instances of a meta-model element which is
parameterisable (see above). In reality, what we have found here is
another pattern:

- there are templates as model elements. When we create a template we
  are instantiating a template's template.
- we can then constrain the world of possibilities in to a
  well-defined set of parameters which are needed for the specific
  template that we are working on. This has a meta-model element
  associated with it, and a file.
- the file is the template file. In the case of wale, the template
  file is then instantiated. This is done by associating facets with
  the wale templates, and for each facet, supplying the arguments to
  instantiate the template. We then end up with a number of actual
  CPP/HPP files.
- for stitch the process is a bit different. The main problem is
  because we incorrectly "weaved" the arguments into the stitch
  template. It made sense at the time purely because we don't really
  expect to instantiate a given stitch template N times; it is really
  only done once. This was slightly misleading. Because of this we
  hard-coded the behaviour related to certain keys (e.g. includes,
  etc). If instead we somehow handle stitch in exactly the same way as
  we handle wale, we can keep the templates in a common template
  directory; then associate them to specific facets via meta-data, and
  supply the arguments as part of the same meta-data. The template
  would then just contain the code that would be weaved. A formatter
  is then a meta-model element associated with a wale template for the
  header file and - very interestingly - a wale template for the cpp
  file _which generates stitch templates_. The user then manually
  fills in the stitch template, but supplies any parameters (remember
  these are fixed) in the meta-model element. Generation will then
  produce the CPP
- the logical consequence of this approach is that we must reference
  the c++ generation model in order to create new formatters, because
  it will contain the templates. However, because the wale content of
  the template is located in the filesystem, it will not be possible
  to instantiate the template. We need instead to find a way to embed
  the content of the template into the model element itself. Then the
  reference would be sufficient. The downside is that, in the absence
  of org-mode injectors, these templates will be extremely difficult
  to manage (imagine having to update a dia comment with a wale
  template every time you need to change the template). On the plus
  side, we wouldn't have to have a set of files in the filesystem,
  which would make things a bit "neater".
- in fact, we have two use cases: the templates which generate
  generators (e.g. stitch) and so must be loaded into the code
  generator and the templates which are a DSL and so can be
  interpreted. Ultimately these should have a JSON object as
  input. Ultimately there should be a JSON representation of instances
  of the meta-model that can be used as input. However, what we are
  saying is that there is a ladder of flexibility and each has its own
  use cases:

  - code generated;
  - code generated with overrides;
  - DSL templates;
  - generator templates;
  - handcrafted

  Each of these has a role to play.

*Integration of archetypes into assets*

Up to recently, there was a belief that the archetypes model was
distinct from the assets model. The idea was that the projection of
assets into archetype space could be done without knowledge of the
things we are projecting. However, that is demonstrably false: n order
to project we need a name. That name contains a location. The location
is a point on a one-dimensional asset space.

In reality, what we always had is:

- a first dimension within assets space: "modeling dimension",
  "logical dimension"? It has an associated location.
- a second dimension within assets space: "physical dimension", with
  an associated location. Actually we cannot call it physical because
  physical is understood to mean the filesystem.

So it is that concepts such as archetype, facet and technical space
are all part of assets - they just happen to be part of the
two-dimensional projection. Generation is in effect a collection of
model to text transforms that adapts the two-dimensional element
representation into the extraction meta-model. Formatters are model to
text transforms which bind to locations in the physical dimension.

In this view of the world, we have meta-model elements to declare
archetypes, with their associated physical locations. This then
results in the injection of these meta-elements. Formatters bind to
these locations.

However, note that formatters provide dependencies. This is because
these are implementation dependent. This means we still need some
transforms to occur at the generation level. However, all of the
dependencies which are modeling related should happen within
assets. Only those which are formatter specific should happen in
generation. The problem though is that at present we deem all
dependencies to be formatter specific and each formatter explicitly
names its dependencies against which facets. It does make sense for
these to be together.

Perhaps what we are trying to say is that there are 3 distinct
concepts:

- modeling locations;
- logical locations;
- physical locations.

The first two are within the domain of assets. The last one is in the
domain of generation and extraction. Assets should make the required
data structures available, but it is the job of generation to populate
this information. Thus directory themes, locator, etc are all
generation concepts.

One could, with a hint of humour, call the "logical dimension" the
meta-physical dimension. This is because it provides the meta-concepts
for the physical dimension.

A backend provides a translation into a representation considered
valid according to the rules of a technical space. A backend can be
the primary or secondary backend for a technical space. A component
can only have a primary backend, and any number of secondary
backends. Artefacts produced by a backend must have a unique physical
location. In LAM mode, the component is split into multiple
components, each with their own primary technical space.

*Make creating new facets easier*

For types that are stitchable such as formatters, we need to always
copy and paste the template form another formatter and then update
values. It would be great if we could have dogen generate a bare-bones
stitch template. This is pretty crazy so it requires a bit of
concentration to understand what we're doing here:

- detect that the =yarn::object= is annotated as
  =quilt.cpp.types.class_implementation.formatting_style= =stitch=.
- find the corresponding expected stitch file. If none is available,
  /dynamically/ change the =formatting_style= to =stock= and locate a
  well-known stitch formatter.
- the stitch formatter uses a stitch template that generates stitch
  templates. Since we cannot escape stitch markup, we will have to use
  the assistant. One problem we have is that the formatter does not
  state all of the required information such as what yarn types does
  it format and so forth. We probably need a meta-model concept to
  capture the idea of formatters - and this could be in yarn - and
  make sure it has all of this information. This also has the
  advantage of making traits, initialisers etc easier. We can do the
  same for helpers too.
- an additional wrinkle is that we need different templates for
  different languages. However, perhaps these are just wale templates
  in disguise rather than stitch templates? Then we can have the
  associated default wale templates, very much in the same way we have
  wale templates for the header files. They just happen to have stitch
  markup rather than say C++ code.

This is a radically different way from looking at the code. We are now
saying that yarn should have concepts for:

- facets: specialisation of modules with meta-data such as facet name
  etc. This can be done via composition to make our life easier.
- formatters and helpers: elements which belong to a facet and know of
  their archetype, wale templates, associated yarn element and so
  forth.

We then create stereotypes for these just like we did for
=enumeration=. As part of the yarn parsing we instantiate these
meta-objects with all of their required information. In addition, we
need to create what we are calling at present "profiles" to define
their enablement and to default some of its meta-data.

When time comes for code-generation, these new meta-types behave in a
more interesting way:

- if there is no stitch template, we use wale to generate it.
- once we have a stitch template, we use stitch to generate the c++
  code. From then on, we do not touch the stitch template. This
  happens because overwrite is set to false on the enablement
  "profile".

Merged stories:

*Code generate initialisers and traits*

If we could mark the modules containing facets with a stereotype
somehow - say =facet= for example, we could automatically inject two
meta-types:

- =initialzer=: for each type marked as =requires_initialisation=,
  register the formatter. Register the types as a formatter or as a
  helper.
- =traits=: for each formatter in this module (e.g. classes with the
  stereotype of =C++ Artefact Formatter= or =C# Artefact Formatter=),
  ask for their archetype. The formatters would have a meta-data
  parameter to set their archetype. In fact we probably should have a
  separate meta-data parameter (archetype source? archetype?).

We may need to solve the stereotype registration problem though, since
only C++ would know of this facet. Or we could hard-code it in yarn
for now.

Notes:

- how does the initialiser know the formatter is a =quilt.cpp=
  formatter rather than say a C# formatter? this could be done via the
  formatter's archetype - its the kernel.
- users can make use of this very same mechanism to generate their own
  formatters. We can then load up the DLL with boost plugin. Note that
  users are not constrained by the assets meta-model. That is to say,
  they can create new meta-types and inject them into assets. Whilst
  we don't support this use case at present, we should make sure the
  framework does not preclude it. Their DLL then defines the
  formatters which are able to process those meta-types. The only snag
  in all of this is the expansion machinery. We use static visitors
  all over the place, and without somehow dynamically knowing about
  the new types, they will not get expanded. We need to revisit
  expansion in this light to see if there is a way to make it more
  dynamic somehow, or at least have a "default" behaviour for all
  unknown types where we do the generic things to them such as
  computing the file path, etc. This is probably sufficient for the
  vast majority of use cases. The other wrinkle is also locator. We
  are hard-coding paths. If the users limit themselves to creating
  "regular" entities rather than say CMakeLists/msbuild like entities
  which have some special way to compute their names, then we don't
  have a problem. But there should be a generic way to obtain all path
  elements apart from the file name from locator. And also perhaps
  have facets that do not have a facet directory so that we can place
  types above the facet directories such as SLNs, CMakeLists, etc.

*** STARTED Create the concept of Text-to-Text transforms             :story:

Whilst trying to understand how stitch transforms fit on the existing
framework, we realised that there is a kind of transform that is not
particularly well defined in MDE terms: T2T transforms. We need to
check the literature for these. The idea is that we've already gone
from a model transformation into text but we need to subsequently
mutate that text. This is a very helpful concept for adding cartridges
to the MASD framework:

- clang format: input is the artefact, output is the artefact.
- stitch template: input is the model element, and the artefact of the
  template, output is a second artefact.
- ODB: input is a model element with ODB configuration and an artefact
  (pragmas), output are N well-defined artefacts.
- protobuf: input is an artefact (possibly plus a model element for
  configuration), output is N well-defined artefacts.

And so forth. To generalise this, we could say that there are T2T
transforms that can take inputs (model element, artefact) and are
associated with outputs. For the text transforms we should use lists
of shared pointers to artefacts instead of references (because of the
N thing).

T2T transforms are declared with archetypes (inputs and outputs) and
against a model element. The T2T chain is simply to go through all the
registered T2T transforms, locate their meta-model element, locate the
archetypes then execute the transform. They should all live in
=m2t=. Actually because they are archetype dependent, they must live
with the technical space.

We should also make sure the skeleton for formatters generates a
simple empty artefact that is suitable for modeling the outputs of a
T2T transform.

We've had nothing but problems with both coveralls and CodeCov. We
should investigate how to move code coverage to plain CDash. We should
also investigate if some of our problems are not related to kcov
(though I very much doubt it). However its not clear if kcov will work
with CDash. We should try to see if we can get it to work given that
kcov is so simple to setup.

We need to setup coverage for the debug clang build and the nightly
clang build.

It seems pretty straightforward to enable llvm-cov:

: set(CTEST_COVERAGE_COMMAND "llvm-cov-8")
: set(CTEST_COVERAGE_EXTRA_FLAGS "gcov")
:   "-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-g -O0 --coverage"
:     "-DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-g -O0 --coverage"
:     "-DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS=--coverage"

Notes from previous implementation:

: if(WITH_PROFILING)
:    # enable code profiling options
:    set(profiling_flags "-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage")
: endif()

:    # setup gcov
:    find_program(CTEST_COVERAGE_COMMAND NAMES gcov-4.7 gcov)
:    if(NOT CTEST_COVERAGE_COMMAND)
:        message("gcov not found, disabling coverage.")
:        set(WITH_COVERAGE false)
:    else()
:        message("Found gcov (${CTEST_COVERAGE_COMMAND})...")
:        set(WITH_COVERAGE true)
:    endif()

:                if(WITH_COVERAGE AND CTEST_COVERAGE_COMMAND)
:                    ctest_coverage()
:                endif()

Notes:

- we need to add coverage to c++ ref impl as well.

*** Hello world segfaults                                             :story:

At present running hello world results on a segfault:

*** Inject backend, facets and archetypes into PMM                    :story:

At present we only have artefacts in the PMM. We need to inject all
other missing elements. We also need to create a transform which
builds the PMM. Finally while we're at it we should add enablement
properties and associated transform.

Notes:

- we should also change template instantiation code to use the PMM.
- once we have a flag, we can detect disabled backends before any work
  is carried out. The cost should be very close to zero. We don't need
  to do any checks for this afterwards.
- we need to add a list of archetypes that each archetype depends
  on. We need to update the formatters to return archetypes rather
  than names and have the dependencies there.

Merged stories:

*Implement archetype locations from physical meta-model*

We need to use the new physical meta-model to obtain information about
the layout of physical space, replacing the archetype locations.

Tasks:

- make the existing backend interface return the layout of physical
  space.
- create a transform that populates all of the data structures needed
  by the current code base (archetype locations).
- replace the existing archetype locations with a physical meta-model.
- remove all the archetype locations data structures.

Notes:

- template instantiation domains should be a part of the physical
  meta-model. Create a transform to compute these. *done*
- remove Locatable from Element? *done*

Merged stories:

*Clean-up archetype locations modeling*

We now have a large number of containers with different aspects of
archetype locations data. We need to look through all of the usages of
archetype locations and see if we can make the data structures a bit
more sensible. For example, we should use archetype location id's
where possible and only use the full type where required.

Notes:

- formatters could return id's?
- add an ID to archetype location; create a builder like name builder
  and populate ID as part of the build process.

*Implement the physical meta-model*

We need to replace the existing classes around archetype locations
with the new meta-model types.

Notes:

- formatters should add their data to a registrar that lives in the
  physical model rather than expose it via an interface.

*** Split enablement features                                         :story:

At present we are instantiating the =enabled= feature across the
entire =masd= template instantiation domain. This is a very
"efficient" way to do it because we only define one feature. However,
it also means its now possible to disable a facet or backend at the
element level. And worse, the binding point is global:

: #DOGEN masd.variability.default_binding_point=any
: #DOGEN masd.variability.generate_static_configuration=false
: #DOGEN masd.variability.instantiation_domain_name=masd

The right thing to do is to create four separate features, one for
the backend, one for the features and one for the archetype
(global). Then another one for the archetype, locally. Each with the
correct binding point.

*** Add PMM enablement transform                                      :story:

This transform reads the global enablement flags for backend, facet
and archetype. It is done as part of the chain to produce the PMM.

*** Add a PMM enablement satisfiability transform                     :story:

For now this transform can simply check that there are no enabled
archetypes that depend on disabled archetypes. In the future we could
have a flag that enables archetypes as required.

*** Add =is_generatable= to logical model                             :story:

Logical types which cannot be generated should be removed prior to
physical expansion. There are two types:

- intrinsically non-generatable types such as object templates, etc.
- types that may not be generated depending on state: modules.

In the future, when we support the static / dynamic pattern,

Tasks:

- add a generatable flag in logical model elements with associated
  transform.
- add a pruning transform that filters out all non-generatable types
  from logical model.

Merged stories:

*Intrinsic non-generatable types

In the decoration transform we have this hack:

: bool decoration_transform::
: is_generatable(const assets::meta_model::name& meta_name) {
:     // FIXME: massive hack for now.
:     using mnf = assets::helpers::meta_name_factory;
:     static const auto otn(mnf::make_object_template_name());
:     static const auto ln(mnf::make_licence_name());
:     static const auto mln(mnf::make_modeline_name());
:     static const auto mgn(mnf::make_modeline_group_name());
:     static const auto gmn(mnf::make_generation_marker_name());
:
:     const auto id(meta_name.qualified().dot());
:     return
:         id != otn.qualified().dot() &&
:         id != ln.qualified().dot() &&
:         id != mln.qualified().dot() &&
:         id != mgn.qualified().dot() &&
:         id != gmn.qualified().dot();
: }

This is done because we know up front that some elements in the assets
meta-model cannot be generated. We need a way to tag this elements
statically. This should be done when the elements are code
generated. It is not yet clear how this should be done though.

Notes:

- one possible approach is to have a constant that is code generated
  which states if a type is meant for generation or not.
- however, it would be even better if we could determine if a type has
  formatters or not. This would mean we would cover two possible
  scenarios: types that are intrinsically non-generatable and types
  that are not yet generatable. It may be that there is no need to
  distinguish between these two.
- when we have meta-model elements for logical meta-elements we just
  need to add this as a property (e.g. generatable). If a user tries
  to add a formatter to a non-generatable type we error.

*** Create a physical ID in logical-physical space                    :story:

Artefacts are points in logical-physical space. They should have an ID
which is composed by both logical and physical location. We could
create a very simple builder that concatenates both, for example:

: <dogen><variability><entities><default_value_override>|<masd><cpp><types><class_header>

The use of =|= would make it really easy to split out IDs as required,
and to visually figure out which part is which. Note though that the
ID is an opaque identifier and the splitting happens for
troubleshooting purposes only, not in the code. With the physical
model, all references are done using these IDs. So for example, if an
artefact =a0= depends on artefact =a1=, the dependency is recorded as
the ID of =a1=. The physical model should also be indexed by ID
instead of being a list of artefacts.

*** Make physical model name a qualified name                         :story:

At present we are setting up the extraction model name from the simple
name of the model. It should really be the qualified name. Hopefully
this will only affect tracing and diffing.

*** Add enablement test in C#                                         :story:

At present we have probably broken enablement in C# due to the hackery
around physical space expansion. However all tests are green. We need
to define a profile in C# that disables a facet in order to ensure we
test enablement before we start hacking around with the enablement
transforms. It will most likely be red - we need to add the pruning
hack to get rid of disabled artefacts as we do in C++.

*** Add dependencies to artefacts                                     :story:

We need to propagate the dependencies between logical model elements
into the physical model. We still need to distinguish between "types"
of dependencies:

- transparent_associations
- opaque_associations
- associative_container_keys
- parents

Basically, anything which we refer to when we are building the
dependencies for inclusion needs to be represented. We could create a
data structure for this purpose such as "dependencies". We should also
include "namespace" dependencies. These can be obtained by =sort |
uniq= of all of the namespaces for which there are dependencies. These
are then used for C#.

Note however that all dependencies are recorded as logical-physical
IDs.

We also need a way to populate the dependencies as a transform. This
must be done in =m2t= because we need the formatters. We can rely on
the same approach as =inclusion_dependencies= but instead of creating
/inclusion dependencies/, we are just creating /dependencies/.

*** Consider allowing representation of namespaces in file names      :story:

Languages like .Net represent namespacing using dots rather than
separate folders. Perhaps we should support a mode of operation where
all files are placed in a single folder but have the namespacing
encoded in the file name. For example:

: /a_project/types/a.cpp
: /a_project/io/a_io.cpp

would become:

: /a_project/types_a.cpp
: /a_project/io_a_io.cpp

or, using dot notation, so we can distinguish namespaces from
"composite" names:

: /a_project/types.a.cpp
: /a_project/io.a_io.cpp

We do not have a use case for this yet, but it should be fairly
straight forward to add it. We just need meta-data support to enable
the feature and then take it into account when generating the file
names (e.g. instead of using =/= as a separator, use =.=).

Actually this is _almost_ already possible: we provide a facet folder
meta-data that is always used to generate a new folder. If however
there was a way for it to not generate a folder we could achieve
this. For example, say we had to supply:

: /types/

as the facet folder. Then the user could simply supply instead:

: types_
: types.

And no folder would be created.

Notes:

- see also the story on destinations.
- consider splitting this story into two: one is about how folder
  layout (physical) may need to match namespace layout (logical);
  another is related to allowing users to flatten facet
  directories. They have some connection, but its not obvious how much
  they overlap.

*** Add a PM enablement and overwrite transform                       :story:

This relies on PMM enablement flags. Also, it reads the local
archetype enablement and overwrite flags and has the logic to set it
as per current enablement transform.

Once this transform is implemented, we should try disabling the
existing enablement transform and see what breaks.

*** Add a PM enablement satisfiability transform                      :story:

To start with, this should just check to see if any of the
dependencies are disabled. If so it throws. In the future we can add
solving.

*** Add a PM transform to prune disabled artefacts                    :story:

We must first start by expanding the physical space into all possible
points. Once enablement is performed though we can prune all artefacts
that are disabled. Note that we cannot prune based on global
information because archetypes may be enabled locally. However, once
all of the local information has been processed and the enabled flag
has been set, we can then remove all of those with the flag set to
false.

In a world with solving, we just need to make sure solving is slotted
in after enablement and before pruning. It should just work.

This transform is done within the =m2t= model, not the =physical=
model, because we need to remove the artefacts from the =m2t=
collection.

*** Implement formatting styles in physical model                     :story:

We need to move the types related to formatting styles into physical
model, and transfors as well. WE should also address formatting input.

Merged stories:

*Move formatting styles into generation*

We need to support the formatting styles at the meta-model level.

*Replace all formatting styles with the ones in physical model*

We still have a number of copies of this enumeration.

*** Implement locator in physical model                               :story:

Use PMM entities to generate artefact paths, within =m2t=.

Merged stories:

*Create a archetypes locator*

We need to move all functionality which is not kernel specific into
yarn for the locator. This will exist in the helpers namespace. We
then need to implement the C++ locator as a composite of yarn
locator.

*Other Notes*

At present we have multiple calls in locator, which are a bit
ad-hoc. We could potentially create a pattern. Say for C++, we have
the following parameters:

- relative or full path
- include or implementation: this is simultaneously used to determine
  the placement (below) and the extension.
- meta-model element:
- "placement": top-level project directory, source directory or
  "natural" location inside of facet.
- archetype location: used to determine the facet and archetype
  postfixes.

E.g.:

: make_full_path_for_enumeration_implementation

Interestingly, the "placement" is a function of the archetype location
(a given artefact has a fixed placement). So a naive approach to this
seems to imply one could create a data driven locator, that works for
all languages if supplied suitable configuration data. To generalise:

- project directory is common to all languages.
- source or include directories become "project
  sub-directories". There is a mapping between the artefact location
  and a project sub-directory.
- there is a mapping between the artefact location and the facet and
  artefact postfixes.
- extensions are a slight complication: a) we want to allow users to
  override header/implementation extensions, but to do it so for the
  entire project (except maybe for ODB files). However, what yarn's
  locator needs is a mapping of artefact location to  extension. It
  would be a tad cumbersome to have to specify extensions one artefact
  location at a time. So someone has to read a kernel level
  configuration parameter with the artefact extensions and expand it
  to the required mappings. Whilst dealing with this we also have the
  issue of elements which have extension in their names such as visual
  studio projects and solutions. The correct solution is to implement
  these using element extensions, and to remove the extension from the
  element name.
- each kernel can supply its configuration to yarn's locator via the
  kernel interface. This is fairly static so it can be supplied early
  on during initialisation.
- there is still something not quite right. We are performing a
  mapping between some logical space (the modeling space) and the
  physical space (paths in the filesystem). Some modeling elements
  such as the various CMakeLists.txt do not have enough information at
  the logical level to tell us about their location; at present the
  formatter itself gives us this hint ("include cmakelists" or "source
  cmakelists"?). It would be annoying to have to split these into
  multiple archetypes just so we can have a function between the
  archetype location and the physical space. Although, if this is the
  only case of a modeling element not mapping uniquely, perhaps we
  should do exactly this.
- However, we still have inclusion paths to worry about. As we done
  with the source/include directories, we need to somehow create a
  concept of inclusion path which is not language specific; "relative
  path" and "requires relative path" perhaps? These could be a
  function of archetype location.

Merged stories:

*Generate file paths as a transform*

We need to understand how file paths are being generated at present;
they should be a transform inside generation.

*Create the notion of project destinations*

At present we have conflated the notion of a facet, which is a logical
concept, with the notion of the folders in which files are placed - a
physical concept. We started thinking about addressing this problem by
adding the "intra-backend segment properties", but as the name
indicates, we were not thinking about this the right way. In truth,
what we really need is to map facets (better: archetype locations) to
"destinations".

For example, we could define a few project destinations:

: masd.generation.destination.name="types_headers"
: masd.generation.destination.folder="include/masd.cpp_ref_impl.northwind/types"
: masd.generation.destination.name=top_level (global?)
: masd.generation.destination.folder=""
: masd.generation.destination.name="types_src"
: masd.generation.destination.folder="src/types"
: masd.generation.destination.name="tests"
: masd.generation.destination.folder="tests"

And so on. Then we can associate each formatter with a destination:

: masd.generation.cpp.types.class_header.destination=types_headers

Notes:

- these should be in archetypes models.
- with this we can now map any formatter to any folder, particularly
  if this is done at the element level. That is, you can easily define
  a global mapping for all formatters, and then override it
  locally. This solves the long standing problem of creating say types
  in tests and so forth. With this approach you can create anything
  anywhere.
- we need to have some tests that ensure we don't end up with multiple
  files with the same name at the same destination. This is a
  particular problem for CMake. One alternative is to allow the
  merging of CMake files, but we don't yet have a use case for
  this. The solution would be to have a "merged file flag" and then
  disable all other facets.
- this will work very nicely with profiles: we can create a few out of
  the box profiles for users such as flat project, common facets and
  so on. Users can simply apply the stereotype to their models. These
  are akin to "destination themes". However, we will also need some
  kind of "variable replacement" so we can support cases like
  =include/masd.cpp_ref_impl.northwind/types=. In fact, we also have
  the same problem when it comes to modules. A proper path is
  something like:
  - =include/${model_modules_as_dots}/types/${internal_modules_as_folders}=
  - =include/${model_modules_as_dots}/types/${internal_modules_as_dots}.=
  - =include/${model_modules_as_dots}/types/${internal_modules_as_underscores}_=

  This is *extremely* flexible. The user can now create a folder
  structure that depends on package names etc or choose to flatten it
  and can do so for one or all facets. This means for example that we
  could use nested folders for =include=, not use model modules for
  =src= and then flatten it all for =tests=.
- actually it is a bit of a mistake to think of these destinations as
  purely physical. In reality, we may also need them to contribute to
  namespaces. For example, in java the folders and namespaces must
  match. We could solve this by having a "module contribution" in the
  destination. These would then be used to construct the namespace for
  a given facet. Look for java story on backlog for this.
- this also addresses the issue of having multiple serialisation
  formats and choosing one, but having sensible folder names. For
  example, we could have boost serialisation mapped to a destination
  called =serialisation=. Or we could map it to say RapidJSON
  serialisation. Or we could support two methods of serialisation for
  the same project. The user chooses where to place them.

*** Implement dependencies in terms of new physical types             :story:

- add dependency types to physical model.
- add dependency types to logical model, as required.
- compute dependencies in generation. We need a way to express
  dependencies as a file dependency as well as a model
  dependency. This caters for both C++ and C#/Java.
- remove dependency code from C++ and C# model.

Notes:

- in light of the new physical model, we need a transform that calls
  the formatter to obtain dependencies. The right way to do this is to
  have another registrar (=dependencies_transform=?) and to have the
  formatters implement both interfaces. This means we can simply not
  implement the interface (and not register) when we have no
  dependencies - though of course given the existing wale
  infrastructure, we will then need yet another template for
  formatters which do not need d

Merged stories:

*Formatter dependencies and model processing*

At present we are manually adding the includes required by a formatter
as part of the "inclusion_dependencies" building. There are several
disadvantages to this approach:

- we are quite far down the pipeline. We've already passed all the
  model building checks, etc. Thus, there is no way of knowing what
  the formatter dependencies are. At present this is not a huge
  problem because we have so few formatters and their dependencies are
  mainly on the standard library and a few core boost models. However,
  as we add more formatters this will become a bigger problem. For
  example, we've added formatters now that require access to
  variability headers; in an ideal world, we should now need to have a
  reference to this model (for example, so that when we integrate
  package management we get the right dependencies, etc).
- we are hard-coding the header files. At present this is not a big
  problem. To be honest, we can't see when this would be a big
  problem, short of models changing their file names and/or
  locations. Nonetheless, it seems "unclean" to depend on the header
  file directly.
- the dependency is on c++ code rather than expressed via a model.

In an ideal world, we would have some kind of way of declaring a
formatter meta-model element, with a set of dependencies declared via
meta-data. These are on the model itself. They must be declared
against a specific archetype. We then would process these as part of
resolution. We would then map the header files as part of the existing
machinery for header files.

However one problem with this approach is that we are generating the
formatter code using stitch at present. For this to work we would need
to inject a fragment of code into the stitch template somehow with the
dependencies. Whilst this is not exactly ideal, the advantage is that
we could piggy-back on this mechanism to inject the postfix fields as
well, so that we don't need to define these manually in each
model. However, this needs some thinking because the complexity of
defining a formatter will increase yet again. When there are problems,
it will be hard to troubleshoot.

*Move dependencies into archetypes*

Actually the dependencies will be generated at the kernel level
because 99% of the code is kernel specific. However, we need to make
it an external transform. We need to figure out an interface that
supplies archetypes with the data needed to create the dependencies
container.

Tasks:

- create the locator in the C++ external transform
- create a dependencies transform that uses the existing include
  generation code.

*Previous understanding*

It seems all languages we support have some form of "dependencies":

- in c++ these are the includes
- in c# these are the usings
- in java these are the imports

So, it would make sense to move these into yarn. The process of
obtaining the dependencies must still be done in a kernel dependent
way because we need to build any language-specific structures that the
dependencies builder requires. However, we can create an interface for
the dependencies builder in yarn and implement it in each kernel. Each
kernel must also supply a factory for the builders.

*Tidy-up of inclusion terminology*

Random notes:

- imports and exports
- some types support both (headers)
- some support imports only (cpp)
- some support neither (cmakelists, etc).

*** Merge C++ and C# model into =m2t=                                 :story:

Once we remove all of formatables and helpers from each technical
space and once we remove all of the transforms in =m2t= that don't
really belong there, we can probably merge all of these models into
one. We would then have a =transforms= namespace, with sub-namespaces
per language. Each of the namespaces is declared as a backend.

*** Top-level "inclusion required" should be "tribool"                :story:

One of the most common use cases for inclusion required is to have it
set to true for all types where we provide an override, but false for
all other cases. This makes sense in terms of use cases:

- either we need to supply some includes; in which case where we do
  not supply includes we do not want the system to automatically
  compute include paths;
- or we don't supply any includes, in which case:
  - we either don't require any includes at all (hardware built-ins);
  - or we want all includes to be computed by the system.

The problem is that we do not have a way to express this logic in the
meta-data. The only way would be to convert the top-level
=requires_includes= to an enumeration:

- yes, compute them
- yes, where supplied
- no

We need to figure out how to implement this. For now we are manually
adding flags.

*** Add the notion of a major and a minor technical space             :story:

When we move visual studio and other elements out of the current
technical spaces, we will need some way of distinguishing between a
"primary" technical space (e.g. C++, C# etc) and a "secondary"
technical space (e.g. visual studio, etc). We could use emacs'
convention and call these major and minor technical spaces.

This should be a property of the backend.

*** Move decorations to their "final" resting place                   :story:

At present we are handling decorations in the generation model but
these are really logical concerns. The main reason why is because we
are not expanding the decoration across physical space, but instead we
expand them depending on the used technical spaces. However, since the
technical spaces are obtained from the formatters, there is an
argument to say that archetypes should have an associated technical
space. We need to decouple these concepts in order to figure out where
they belong.

*** Create a common formatter interface                               :story:

Once all language specific properties have been moved into their
rightful places, we should be able to define a formatter interface
that is suitable for both c++ and c# in generation. We should then
also be able to move all of the registration code into generation. We
then need to look at all containers of formatters etc to see what
should be done at generation level.

Once we have a common formatter interface, we can add the formatters
themselves to the =element_artefacts= tuple. Then we can just iterate
through the tuples and call the formatter instead having to do
look-ups.

Also, at this point we can then update the physical elements generated
code to generate the transform code for backend and facet
(e.g. delegation and aggregation of the result).

*** Stitch formatter updates                                          :story:

There are a number of issues with stitch formatters at present:

- stitch transform is still generating its own artefact.

*** Order of headers is hard-coded                                    :story:

In inclusion expander, we have hacked the sorting:

:        // FIXME: hacks for headers that must be last
:        const bool lhs_is_gregorian(
:            lhs.find_first_of(boost_serialization_gregorian) != npos);
:        const bool rhs_is_gregorian(
:            rhs.find_first_of(boost_serialization_gregorian) != npos);
:        if (lhs_is_gregorian && !rhs_is_gregorian)
:            return true;

This could be handled via meta-data, supplying some kind of flag (sort
last?). We should try to generate the code in the "natural order" and
see if the code compiles with latest boost.

*** Move technical space and generability transforms                  :story:

At present these transforms are in generation, but we don't think
that's the right place. We need some analysis to understand what they
do and why they are not in the logical model.

*** Consider bucketing elements by meta-type in generation model      :story:

At the moment we have a flat container of elements in the main
model. However, it seems like one of its use cases will be to bucket
the elements by meta-type before processing: formatters will want to
locate all formatters for a given meta-type and apply them all. At
present we are asking for the formatters for meta-name
repeatedly. This makes no sense, we should just ask for them once and
apply all formatters in one go.

For this we could simply group elements by meta-name in the model
itself and then use that container at formatting time. However, there
may be cases where looping through the whole model is more convenient
(during transforms) so this is not without its downsides.

Alternatively we could consider just bucketing in the formatters'
workflow itself.

This work will only be useful once we get rid of the formattables
model.

This can be done in the generation model, as part of the generation
clean up.

*** Dimension vs view vs perspective                                  :story:

We need to find the definition for how these terms are used within
UML and see which one is more appropriate for MASD.

*** Private and public includes                                       :story:

#+begin_quote
*Story*: As a dogen user, I want to hide some internal types from
users so that I don't increase coupling for no reason.
#+end_quote

NOTE: We should use the terms =internal= and =external= to avoid
confusion with C++ scopes. This follows Microsoft terminology for C#
assemblies.

At present we are making all headers in a model public. However, for
models such as cpp this doesn't make any sense since only one type
should be available to the outside world. What we really need is a
separation between public and private headers, a functionality similar
to =internal= in C#. In conjunction with using shared objects, this
should improve build times.

In order to do this:

- add a new config parameter: default visibility to private or default
  visibility to public. This is just so we don't have to mark all
  types manually - instead we just need to mark the exceptions.
- add two new stereotypes: =public= and =private=.
- add enum to sml: =visibility_type= (check with .Net for
  names). Valid values are =public=, =private=. Objects, enumerations,
  etc will have this enum.
- locator will now respect this value when producing an absolute file
  path. If public files go under =include/public=, if private files go
  under =include/private=.
- CMakelists for the component will add to the include path the
  private directory. Same for the spec CMakelists. Need to check that
  this not add to the global include path.
- CMakelists for the include files will only package the public
  headers.
- mark all the types accordingly in all our models. fix all the
  ensuing breakage. we will probably need to move forward on the IoC
  front in order for this to work as we don't want to expose
  implementations - e.g. =workflow_interface= will be public but
  =workflow= will be private; this means we need some kind of factory
  to generate =workflow_interface=.

More thoughts on this:

- we don't really need to have different directories for this; we
  could just put all the include files in the same directory. At
  packaging time, we should only package the public files (this would
  have to be done using CPack).
- also the GCC/MSVC visibility pragmas should take into account these
  options and only export public types.
- the slight problem with this is that we need some tests to ensure
  the packages we create are actually exporting all public types; we
  could easily have a public type that depends on a private type
  etc. We should also validate yarn to ensure this does not
  happen. This can be done by ensuring that a type marked as external
  only depends on types also marked as external and so forth.
- this could also just be a packaging artefact - we would only package
  public headers. Layout of source code would remain the same.
- when module support is available, we could use this to determine
  what is exported on the module interfaces.

*** Replace traits with calls to the PMM elements                     :story:

Where we are using these traits classes, we should really be including
the formatter and calling for its static name - at least within each
backend.

*** Associate includes with model elements                            :story:

The right solution for the formatter includes is to supply them as
meta-data in the model element. This has the advantage that we can
then make use of profiles. At present we have one way to supply
includes: the primary and secondary includes:

: "masd.generation.cpp.io.class_header.primary_inclusion_directive": "<boost/property_tree/json_parser.hpp>",
: "masd.generation.cpp.io.class_header.secondary_inclusion_directive": "<boost/algorithm/string.hpp>",

This does a part of the job: we can associate up to two include
directives with one facet and element. However:

- by using this machinery we are effectively replacing the original
  include.
- the includes will occur for anyone who references the type. Though
  however, since the includes are applicable only to the class
  implementation this is less of a problem. Technically its still
  incorrect though because these are not the includes needed to use
  the type but the includes needed to define the type.

For formatters, we kind of need to make the includes only happen when
we are building the formatter. If we could have a similar machinery,
but without adding to types referencing the type, this would give us a
way to declare all of the formatters dependencies. Then, we could
switch to building all of the stitch boilerplate outside of stitch and
supplying it as a KVP.

*** CANCELLED Support for platform specific code                      :story:
    CLOSED: [2020-04-17 Fri 07:53]

*Rationale*: there is no generic solution for this; we will have to
handle it on a case by case basis.

There are some features which may only make sense on a given platform,
or may have different expressions depending on a platform. For
example, [[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa370448%2528v%3Dvs.85%2529.aspx][DLL Main]] is required on Windows but not on UNIX. These files
must be correctly handled by CMake such that they are excluded on UNIX
and added on Windows. Same with [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precompiled_header][StdAfx.h]] and cpp, which will require
looking into pre-compiled headers support in CMake.

 : The file "cpp_ref_impl.boost_model/src/types/class_a.cpp" isn't available on github. Either it's been removed, or the repo root directory needs to be updated.

 We have the same problem in codecove, only there is worse because we
 also can't see the fake commit we did.
