Title: Dogen v1.0.03, "Pavilhão"

#+begin_src markdown
![Pavilhão Welvitchia Mirabilis](http://cdn2.portalangop.co.ao/angola/pt_pt/files/highlight/2016/9/42/0,cbf98d54-32d3-4634-b996-6dd02337f9ae.jpg)

Overview
=======

We continue with yet another sprint refactoring the core in yarn. Initially, the focus was on moving more code from the C++ and C# kernels into yarn, but a series of deficiencies were found on the way we are processing exogenous models and so we switched focus to fixing those. This work will continue into the next sprint.

As part of this sprint we did manage to move away from using ```std::type_index``` and using instead our own meta-meta-model, which is consistent with our conceptual model and notions of modeling spaces. In addition, we cleaned up usages of the type repository, which greatly simplified the code.

User visible changes
===============
There are no user visible changes in this sprint.

For more details of the work carried out this sprint, see the [sprint log](https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/v1/sprint_backlog_03.org).

Next Sprint
===========
In the next sprint we'll finish the work on exogenous models and resume the work on moving kernel-agnostic transformations from the kernels into yarn.

We need to start using unique pointers in exogenous model, and shared
pointers in intermediate model. We should transfer the ownership as we
go along, making the transformers/adapters mutable.

*** COMPLETED Update repository in yarn.dia to use pointers           :story:
    CLOSED: [2017-08-04 Fri 17:14]

At present we are using a three-way map from dia object (child) to dia
object (parent) and then from parent to name and then from name to
element. Once the models have pointers we can simply map dia object
directly to parent (and module).

- dia id to module name.
- dia id to parent names
- model name

Notes:

- due to the way we now record parent and child relationships in the
  graph, we caused the order of parents to move. Before we used to
  keep track of all parents for a given child; we now keep track of
  all children for a given parent. When builder starts accumulating
  parents for each children, it now does so from the parent's
  perspective. This seems to have caused the order of the parents to
  change. However, since we still do things in diagram order,
  hopefully the order is stable - just different.

Tasks:

- move model out of repository, into builder.
- rename repository to context.
- create two maps for modules and parent names in context, delete existing maps.
- delete selector.

*** COMPLETED Remove support for upsilon                              :story:

    CLOCK: [2017-08-08 Tue 06:54]--[2017-08-08 Tue 08:04] =>  1:10

It seems we will no longer be using upsilon, so we should remove it as
its adding to the maintenance costs. If required in the future we can
always resurrect it.

This will also hopefully free up some time in the build machine,
solving the amount of red builds we get due to time outs.

*** COMPLETED Add a backwards compatible flag                         :story:
    CLOSED: [2017-08-17 Thu 14:37]

    CLOCK: [2017-08-17 Thu 10:15]--[2017-08-17 Thu 10:32] =>  0:17

Backwards compatibility is a problem; we should be able to ignore
types that do not exist. This could be achieved by adding a "backwards
compatibility mode" flag to the command line which tells annotations
transform to proceed regardless. This way we still get strict checking
for the common use case, but can override when required. Log can
suggest this command line option, with a warning.

At present we are allowing the frontends to directly create
intermediate models. However, this doesn't make a lot of sense: there
are many properties in the intermediate models which should not be
touched by the frontends. We should have a specific model that has
only the properties that can be set by the frontends -
=exogenous_model=. The exogenous model chain is then responsible for
converting it into an intermediate model.

Tasks:

- create the exogenous model with the required attributes. Add a root
  module, remove model name. All containers should be lists of a pair
  of scribble group to concrete element.
- move annotations transform to exogenous chain. Add a transform to
  update element names by reading model modules and external modules.
- drop scribble groups from intermediate model.
- add an adaptor to convert from exogenous model to intermediate
  model.
- use some kind of reference to figure out where to place the
  documentation of a module. We can't use the IDs any longer. We could
  simply remember the list iterators. Since we are only pushing back
  into the list, the iterators should remain valid. However, for this
  to work we need to add support to iterators in dogen or manually
  create the context/repository.
- Refactor yarn.dia, splitting out the model from the repository and
  renaming repository to context.

Notes:

- we need a completely different annotations transform. In the new
  world, scribble updating and annotation updating are done in one go
  by the updater, who has the annotation group as state. The annotation
  classes need to be updated to take in just one scribble group rather
  than a map. The updater needs to be a regular element visitor. The
  transform runs on the exogenous model.
- repository in yarn.dia must not rely on qualified names for lookups;
  instead it must have a pointer to the element, which is known to be
  owned by the model. To make life easier this could be a shared
  pointer with a custom deleter.
- if we changed the graph adding a relationship between the note and
  the package such that the package is always processed after the
  notes it contains; and if we created a map of child to note,
  including a special entry for the "root note"; we could then merge
  the processed objects of the package and the note. This would then
  result in a consistent interface for the transformer. Actually this
  must already be occurring since we are updating the documentation of
  an existing module; however, the order must be in reverse -
  i.e. first the package, then the note. We should really do the note
  first then the package. We can simply create a map of ID ->
  processed object; we then remember the module processed object. When
  the note appears we look up the module and merge it.
- we should force json models to have a model module if they want to
  provide documentation rather than support a documentation key.
- compute model name in naming transform and copy it across to
  intermediate model

Steps:

- update scribble group with stereotypes.
- convert scribble group into annotation group.
- process element annotation.
- process attribute annotations, if stateful.

At present we are transforming an intermediate model into the
exogenous representation. However, we can probably get away with just
the exogenous model. Update dehydrator and exogenous interfaces to
work from just exogenous models.

Notes:

- drop documentation field; we can rely on it being present on the
  root module. Which reveals a deeper problem: the model should not be
  annotatable at all, since we have the root module for that. We must
  have some hackery on the hydrator to read the model annotations and
  populate the root module. It makes more sense to populate the root
  module in the JSON.

Now we have an exogenous model we no longer need the scribble group in
the intermediate model. However, we were making use of it in the
dehydration for tailor transformations.

*** COMPLETED Move external module processing into yarn               :story:
    CLOSED: [2017-08-21 Mon 15:20]

*Rationale*: implemented as part of the exogenous model work.

At present we have a hack in =yarn.dia= whereby we are looking for a
key =yarn.dia.external_modules= and then using it to populate the
external module path of all names read on that model, as we traverse
the graph of dia objects.

The problem is, this functionality is also required on other frontends
such as JSON. We should use the traditional annotation machinery to
populate the external modules inside of yarn pre-processing.

One thing to bear in mind is that we need to trash all containers and
re-insert all elements, because the IDs will change as part of this
exercise.

*** COMPLETED Add a property for the model modules as an annotation   :story:
    CLOSED: [2017-08-21 Mon 15:25]

*Rationale*: implemented as part of the exogenous model work.

We should read out the model name as an annotation instead of
inferring it from the filename on some frontends (Dia) and allowing
the user to set it internally on others (JSON).

This is not quite as trivial as it may look: we create the model
module using the model name; this is necessary because we need to read
its annotations and place it in the right element. Without a model
name, this becomes a bit tricky.

*Previous Understanding*

#+begin_quote
*Story*: As a dogen user in a constrained environment, I am forced to
use file names that are not suitable for a model name so that I need
to supply an override somewhere else.
#+end_quote

It would be nice to be able to generate a model with a name other than
the diagram file. We should have a command line option for this that
overrides the default diagram name.

This could also be supplied as part of dynamic extensions. The command
line option is useful when we want to use the same diagram to test
different aspects of the generation, as we do with the tests. The
dynamic extensions option is useful when we don't want the file name
to have the full name of the model.

We now have a use case for this: the dynamic models. See Rename
dynamic models.

*** COMPLETED Use a consistent approach to model naming               :story:
    CLOSED: [2017-08-21 Mon 16:48]

*Rationale*: split into individual stories for each rename.

- exogenous model: exomodel; all the models obtained externally.
- intermediate model: endogenous model, endomodel; all models used internally.
- model: final model, used for code-generation.

With this we can now have three main chains:

- =exomodel_generation_chain=;
- =endomodel_generation_chain=;
- =model_generation_chain=: top-level chain that includes all others.

We should also probably rename the exogenous transforms to
=exomodel_source=. Actually, according to the literature, its still
just a transform.

Now that we've cleaned up the model terminology, we should line up the
chains that create these different types of models, such that each
chain only generates one kind of model and a top-level chain is
responsible from moving from one model type to another - i.e. avoid
creating heterogeneous chains with regards to model type.

Tasks:

- rename endomodel transform to =exomodel_to_endomodel_transform=
- remove endomodel transform from exoendo
- rename exoendo to exomodel generation chain
- add =exomodel_to_endomodel_transform= to both initial target and
  references chains.
- rename model generation chain to endomodel generation chain
- remove final model transform from model assembly chain
- rename final model transform to endomodel to model transform
- create a model generation chain transform which calls the endomodel
  generation chain and then processes the result with the endomodel to
  model transform. Actually, doing this in the code generator
  suffices.

Now we have meta-names we should use the same terminology for JSON
documents.

Notes:

- the meta-name transform must be applied at the exomodel
  level. Otherwise we are generating exomodels without setting their element
  meta-names correctly.
- in addition, we cannot call the entire exomodel generation chain in
  tailor, because that then pulls in the context generation and so
  forth. It also applies the annotations and naming transforms which
  we don't require for tailor. Instead we should just apply the
  meta-name transform manually. To make life easier we could create a
  exomodel to exomodel transform chain in yarn and use that in tailor.
- annoyingly, the exomodel registrar ownership now becomes a bit
  messy. We have to go to the exomodel generation chain to get the
  registrar, but we don't really use it for anything else. However,
  this is no worse than tailor at present.
- we seem to have a "naming" transform and a "meta-name"
  transform. They should be named consistently.

Now that we no longer support upsilon we can revert to the simplistic
approach of matching the file extension to find the exogenous model
transformer.

The name "external transform" was always a quick hack, due to the
confusion between "exogenous" and "external". We should rename it to
"dynamic" given that these transforms are not known until run-time
whereas all other transforms are "static" - known at compile
time. This also means we can now have dynamic transforms in yarn. Not
an ideal name, but ever so slightly better than "external transform".

*** Rename transformers to adapters                                   :story:

In the past we used the term "transformer" to mean a class that
converts types from one representation to another. However, now that
we are using domain terminology, the term "transforms" is taken to
mean a model transformation. To avoid confusion we should rename the
existing transformers to converters, adapters or some other
out-of-the-way name.

*** Throw on unsupported stereotypes                                  :story:

In some cases we may support a feature in one language but not on
others like say ORM at present. If a user requests ORM in a C# model,
we should throw.

If we are in compatibility mode, however, we should not throw.

*** Add a modeline to stitch                                          :story:

It would be nice to be able to supply the mode and other emacs
properties to stitch templates. For that we just need a special KVP
used at the top that contains the modeline:

: <#@ modeline="-*- mode: poly-stitch; tab-width: 4; indent-tabs-mode: nil; -*-" #>

Stitch can read this KVP and ignore it.

*** Change order of includes according to Lakos major design rule     :story:

Lakos says:

#+begin_quote
The .c file of every component should include its own .h file as the
first substantive line of code.
#+end_quote

We decided to include it as the last line. However, Lakos approach has
the side-effect of automatically detecting headers that are missing
includes. We used to do this manually by generating =.cpp= files that
just included the header but then had to remove it because it was
slowing down compilation. With Lakos approach we get the best of both
worlds.

We need to also update the generated code to follow this
approach. This will require some thinking.

*** Investigate usage of origin type                                  :story:

With the current setup of the transforms, we always know who the
target model is. Thus the =origin_types= flag may not be used
correctly at present.

*** Rename ODB parameters                                             :story:

At present we use the following form:

: #DOGEN ODB_PRAGMA=no_id

We need to use the new naming style =cpp.odb.pragma=. We also need to
rename the opaque_parameters to reflect ODB specific data.

Finally we should no longer attempt to derive the ODB pragma
context. We should just add it verbatim.

*** Use namespaced stereotypes                                        :story:

Originally we added a space in the ORM stereotypes:

: orm value

This is not a particularly good idea. We should just add support for
namespaced stereotypes:

: orm::value

We should also change all of the existing stereotypes to have a
namespace:

: modeling::object

And so forth. The namespace name probably needs a bit of thinking.

*** Cannot make qualified references to concepts                      :story:

At present it is not possible to consume concepts defined in a
referenced model, nor is it possible to refer to a concept in a
different module from the module in which the element is in, e.g.: say
concept C0 is declared in module M0; all types of M0 can have C0 as
stereotype and that will resolve. However any types on any other
module cannot see the concept.

One suggestion is to allow scoped names in stereotypes:
=module::Concept=.

*** Add support for cross-model concept refinement                    :story:

We've implemented support for cross-model inheritance in sprint 87 but
we did not cover concepts. Most of the approach is the same, but
unfortunately we can't just reuse it.

Tasks:

- we need a refines field which is a text collection.
- we need refinement settings, factory etc.
- update parsing expander.

*** Add support for "one off" profiles                                :story:

At present one can define top-level profiles. These are useful, but in
practice we ended up still defining a lot of things in each model. We
need a way to associate a profile with a model by supplying it on the
command line. That way users can create profiles and store them next
to the model rather than having to create a data directory, etc etc.

Actually the problem is that profiles aren't really implemented
correctly. First we should not call them profiles at all since they
are not UML profiles and overloading the term just generates
confusion. Second its important to understand how Dogen profiles come
about:

- we extend the UML meta-model via stereotypes to support all of the
  required yarn and quilt concepts.
- when we instantiate the yarn/quilt types via a UML model, we need to
  supply the values for the attributes which have been extended. If
  done properly this would happen via UML tagged values. Dia does not
  support these. At any rate, at present we use Dogen meta-data which
  is almost like tagged values.
- Dogen profiles are then an attempt to create bundles of tagged
  values with pre-populated values so that we do not need to manually
  populate them for every type. Instead, we can associate a stereotype
  with the type and then the system will automatically populate the
  values from the bundle.
- From all of this it follows that it should be possible to define
  these "bundles" directly in a UML diagram. If we were to use UML
  properly (or at least almost properly), we would define a class with
  a stereotype of =stereotype=, a name of the stereotype we'd like to
  define (say =Serializable=) and then its tagged values are the keys
  and values of the meta-data we want to define. This is strictly
  speaking not correct UML because we are stating we are augmenting
  the UML meta-model (hence =stereotype=) but then we end up
  instantiating a meta-model class with some predefined values. Its
  not clear how to express this in UML. Note that we have exactly the
  same issue with concepts.
- and, after some thinking, we are trying to do exactly the same thing
  as we are already doing for concepts: i.e. some kind of meta-level
  operation that allows us to add structural features to an
  element. Thus we can just use concepts, which are not even defined
  in UML - augmenting its meaning will not take us away from the
  literature. We can very simply add a last step to concepts transform
  which merges the annotations of the concept objects, using exactly
  the machinery we defined for profiles. The only slight problem is
  that we cannot reuse concepts across models.

Tasks:

- add annotations merging to concepts processing. Should cause no
  changes at all on all models.
- create a model in dogen defining basic concepts.

*** CANCELLED Map upsilon primitives to intrinsics                    :story:
    CLOSED: [2017-08-08 Tue 06:51]

*Rationale*: Upsilon is to be removed.

Upsilon allows users to create "strong typedefs" around primitve
types. We need to unpack these into their intrinsic counterparts and
them map the intrinsics to native types.

Slight mistake: we mapped the primitive types themselves but in
reality what needs to be mapped are the fields making references to
the primitive types. We should just filter out all primitives.

Additional wrinkle: what the end users want is to unpack "real
primitives" into intrinsics, but "other" primitives should be mapped
to objects. This can be achieved by hard-coding =Plaform= primitives
into the mapping layer. However, some non-platform primitives may also
be candidates too. We need to create a list of these to see how
widespread the problem is.

Another alternative is to apply hard-coded regexes:

- if the name matches any of the intrinsic names

Finally, the last option may be to have yet another mapping data file
format that lists the primitives to unbox.

*** CANCELLED Add mapping support between upsilon and LAM             :story:
    CLOSED: [2017-08-08 Tue 06:51]

*Rationale*: Upsilon is to be removed.

At present we map upsilon directly to a language-specific model
(C++/C#), which gets code-generated. However, from a tailor
perspective, this is not ideal; we would end up with N different
models. Ideally, we should get a LAM representation of the JSON model
which could then be used to code-generate multiple languages.

This is probably not too hard, given the mapper knows how to convert
between upsilon and LAM. We just need to finish LAM support and then
try mapping them and see what breaks. Tailor would have to somehow
tell yarn to set the output language to LAM.

Notes:

- if output is more than one language, change it to LAM. Otherwise
  leave it as language specific.
- we need to inject via meta-data the annotations for the output
  languages.
- We only need to perform mapping if input language is upsilon. For
  all other languages we can leave it as is. But for upsilon, tailor
  needs to do a full intermediate model workflow.
- unparsed type needs to be recomputed as part of mapping.
- we are not adding the LAM mapping to the upsilon id container.
- we need to add support for "default mappings"
