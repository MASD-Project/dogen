# Introduction

Happy new year! The first release of the year is a bit of a bumper one: we finally managed to add support for [org-mode](https://orgmode.org), and transitioned _all_ of Dogen to it. It was a mammoth effort, consuming the entirety of the holiday season, but it is refreshing to finally be able to add significant user facing features again. Alas, this is also a bit of a bitter-sweet release because we have more or less run out of coding time, and need to redirect our efforts towards writing the PhD thesis. On the plus side, the architecture is now up-to-date with the conceptual model, mostly, and the bits that aren't are fairly straightforward (famous last words). And this is nothing new; Dogen development has always oscillated between theory and practice. If you recall, a couple of years ago we had to take a nine-month coding break to learn about the theoretical underpinnings of [MDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_engineering) and then resumed coding on [Sprint 8](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/releases/tag/v1.0.08) for what turned out to be a 22-sprint-long marathon (pun intended), where we tried to apply all that was learned to the code base. Sprint 30 brings this long cycle to a close, and begins a new one; though, this time round, we are hoping for far swifter travels around the literature. But I digress. Lets not get lost talking about the future, and focus instead on the release at hand. And _what_ a release it was.

# User visible changes

This section covers stories that affect end users, with the video providing a quick demonstration of the new features, and the sections below describing them in more detail.

## Org-mode support

A target that we've been chasing for the longest time is the ability to create models using [org-mode](https://orgmode.org). We use org-mode (and [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs)) for pretty much everything in Dogen, such time keeping and task management - it's how we manage our [product](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/product_backlog.org) and [sprint backlogs](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/v1/sprint_backlog_30.org), for one - and we'll soon be using it to write [academic papers](https://jonathanabennett.github.io/blog/2019/05/29/writing-academic-papers-with-org-mode/) too. It's just an amazing tool with a great tooling ecosystem, so it seemed only natural to try and see if we could make use of it for modeling too. Now, even though we are very comfortable with org-mode, this is not a decision to be taken lightly because we've been using [Dia](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Dia) since Dogen's inception, over eight years ago.

![Dia diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MASD-Project/dogen/master/doc/blog/images/colour_coded_uml_diagrams.png)
_Figure 1: Dia diagram for a Dogen model with the introduction of colouring, Dogen [v1.0.06](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/releases/tag/v1.0.06)_

As much as we profoundly love Dia, the truth is we've had concerns about relying on it _too much_ due to its [sparse maintenance](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/dia). In particular, Dia relies on an old version of GTK, meaning it could get pulled from distributions at any time; we've already had a similar experience with [Gnome Referencer](https://tracker.debian.org/news/937606/removed-122-2-from-unstable/), which wasn't at all pleasant. In addition, there are a number of "papercuts" that are mildly annoying, if livable, and which will probably not be addressed; we've curated a list of [such issues](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/v1/sprint_backlog_28.org#dia-limitations-that-impact-dogen-usage), in the hope of _one day_ fixing these problems upstream. The direction of travel for the maintenance is also not entirely aligned with our needs. For example, we recently saw the removal of python support in Dia - at least in the version which ships with Debian - a feature in which we relied upon heavily, and intended to do more so in the future. All of this to say that we've had a number of ongoing worries that motivated our decision to move away from Dia. However,  I don't want to sound too negative here - and please don't take any of this as a criticism to Dia or its developers. Dia is an absolutely brilliant tool, and we have used it for over two decades; It is great at what it does, and we'll continue to use it for free modeling. Nonetheless, it has become increasingly clear that the directions of Dia and Dogen have started to diverge over the last few years, and we could not ignore that. I'd like to take this opportunity to give a huge thanks to all of those involved in Dia (past and present); they have certainly created an amazing tool that stood the test of time. Also, although we are moving away from Dia use in mainline Dogen, we will continue to support the Dia codec and we have tests to ensure that the current set of features [will continue to work](https://github.com/MASD-Project/frozen).

That's that for the rationale for moving away from Dia. But why org-mode? We came up with a nice laundry list of reasons:

- **"Natural" Representation**: org-mode documents are trees, with arbitrary nesting, which makes it a good candidate to represent the nesting of namespaces and classes. It's just a _natural_ representation for structural information.
- **Emacs tooling**: within the org-mode document we have full access to Emacs features. For example, we have spell checkers, regular copy-and-pasting, etc. This greatly simplifies the management of models. Since we already use Emacs for everything else in the development process, this makes the process even more fluid.
- **Universality**: org-mode is fairly universal, with support in [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/vscode-org-mode/vscode-org-mode), [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/organized) and even [Vim](https://github.com/jceb/vim-orgmode) (for more details, see [Get started with Org mode without Emacs](https://opensource.com/article/19/1/productivity-tool-org-mode)). None of these implementations are as good as Emacs, of course - not that we are biased, or anything - but they are sufficient to at least allow for basic model editing. And installing a simple plugin in your editor of choice is much easier than having to learn a whole new tool.
- **"Plainer" plain-text**: org-mode documents are regular text files, and thus easy to life-cycle in a similar fashion to code; for example, one can version control and diff these documents very easily. Now, we did have Dia's files in uncompressed XML, bringing some of these advantages, but due to the verbosity of XML it was very hard to see the wood for the trees. Lots of lines would change every time we touched a model element - and I literally mean "touch" - making it difficult to understand the nature of the change. Bisection for example was not helped by this.
- **Models as documentation**: Dogen aims to take the approach of "Literate Modeling" described in papers such as [Literate Modelling - Capturing Business Knowledge with the UML](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/933/1/10.0_Literate_Modelling.pdf). It was clear from the start that a tool like Dia would not be able to capture the wealth of information we intended to add to the models. Org-mode on the other hand is the ideal format to bring disparate types of information together (see [Replacing Jupyter with Orgmode](https://rgoswami.me/posts/jupyter-orgmode) for an example of the sort of thing we have in mind).
- **Integration with org-babel**: Since models contain fragments of source code, org-mode's support for [working with source code](https://orgmode.org/manual/Working-with-Source-Code.html) will come in handy. This will immediately be really useful for handling text templates, and even more so in the future when we add support for code merging.

Over the past few sprints we've been carrying out a fair bit of experimentation on the side, generating org-mode files from the existing Dia models; it was mostly an exercise in feasibility to see if we could encode all of the required information in a comprehensible manner within the org-mode document.  These efforts convinced us that this was a sensible approach, so this sprint we focused on adding end-to-end support for org-mode. This entailed reading org-mode documents, and using them to generate the exact same code as we had from Dia. Unfortunately, though [C++ support for org-mode exists](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tools/index.html), we could not find any suitable library for integration in Dogen. So we decided to write a simple parser for org-mode documents. This isn't a "generic parser" by any means, so if you throw invalid documents at it, do expect it to blow up _unceremonially_. Figure 2 shows the ```dogen.org``` model represented as a org-mode document.

![Org model in org](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/raw/master/doc/blog/images/dogen_org_model.png)
_Figure 2: ```dogen.org``` model in the org-mode representation._

We tried as much as possible to leverage native org-mode syntax, for example by using [tags](https://orgmode.org/manual/Tags.html) and [property drawers](https://orgmode.org/manual/Property-Syntax.html) to encode Dogen information. However, this is clearly a first pass and many of the decisions may not survive scrutiny. As always, we need to have a great deal of experience editing models to see what works and what does not, and it's likely we'll end up changing the markup in the future. Nonetheless, the guiding principle is to follow the "spirit" of org-mode, trying to make the documents look like "regular" org-mode documents as much as possible. One advantage of this approach is that the existing tooling for org-mode can then be used with Dogen models - for example, [org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com/), [org-ref](https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref) _et al._ Sadly, one feature which we did not manage to achieve was the use of ```stitch-mode``` in the org-babel blocks. It appears there is some kind of incompatibility between org-mode and [polymode](https://github.com/polymode/polymode); more investigation is required, such as for instance playing with the interestingly named [poly-org](https://github.com/polymode/poly-org). As Figure 3 demonstrates, the stitch templates are at present marked as ```fundamental```, but users can activate stitch mode when editing the fragment.

_Figure 3: Stitch template in ```dogen.text``` model._

In order to make our life easier, we implemented conversion support for org-mode:

```
$ head dogen.cli.dia
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<dia:diagram xmlns:dia="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~alla/dia/">
  <dia:diagramdata>
    <dia:attribute name="background">
      <dia:color val="#ffffffff"/>
    </dia:attribute>
    <dia:attribute name="pagebreak">
      <dia:color val="#000099ff"/>
    </dia:attribute>
    <dia:attribute name="paper">
$ dogen.cli convert --source dogen.cli.dia --destination dogen.cli.org
$ head dogen.cli.org
#+title: dogen.cli
#+options: <:nil c:nil todo:nil ^:nil d:nil date:nil author:nil
#+tags: { element(e) attribute(a) module(m) }
:PROPERTIES:

:masd.codec.input_technical_space: cpp
:masd.codec.reference: cpp.builtins
:masd.codec.reference: cpp.std
:masd.codec.reference: cpp.boost
```

This feature was mainly added for our benefit, but it may also be useful for any users that wish to update their models from Dia to org-mode. We made use of conversion to migrate all of the Dogen core models into org-mode, including the library models - though these required a bit of manual finessing to get them into the right shape. We also performed a number of modeling tasks in the sprint using the new format and the work proceeded as expected; see the below sections for links to a video series on this subject. However, one thing we did notice is that we missed the ability to visualise models as UML diagrams. And that gives us a nice segway into the second major story of this sprint.

## Initial PlantUML support

Whilst the advantages of modeling using textual languages over graphical languages are patently obvious, the truth is the modeling process requires _both views_ in order to progress smoothly. Maybe its just me but I get a lot of information about a system very quickly just by looking at a well-curated class diagram. It is especially so when one does not touch a sub-system for extended periods of time; it only takes a few minutes to observe and absorb the structure of the sub-system by looking carefully at its class diagram. In Dogen, we have relied on this since the beginning, particularly because we need to context-switch in-and-out so often. With the move to org-mode we suddenly found ourselves unable to do so, and it was quite disorienting. So we decided to carry out yet another little experiment: to add basic support for [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/). PlantUML is a textual notation that describes pretty much all types of UML diagrams, as well as a tool that converts files in that notation over to a graphical representation. The syntax is very simple and intuitive. Take for example one of the samples they supply:

```PlantUML
@startuml
Class11 <|.. Class12
Class13 --> Class14
Class15 ..> Class16
Class17 ..|> Class18
Class19 <--* Class20
@enduml
```

This very simple and compact notation produces the rather wonderful UML class diagram:

![PlantUML example](https://s.plantuml.com/imgw/img-fa90e8d3b95abb6ff2192dd122b0b7d8.webp)
_Figure 4: UML Class Diagram generated from PlantUML sample. Source: [PlantUML site](https://plantuml.com/class-diagram)._

Given the notation is so straightforward, we decided to create a codec that outputs PlantUML documents, which can then be processed by their tool. To do so, simply convert the model:

```
$ dogen.cli convert --source dogen.cli.org --destination dogen.cli.plantuml
```

The listing below has a fragment of the output produced by Dogen; it contains the PlantUML representation of the ```dogen.org``` model from Figure 2.

```PlantUML
@startuml
set namespaceSeparator ::
note as N1
Provides support for encoding and decoding Emacs's org-mode
documents.

The support is very basic and focuses only on the features
of org mode required by Dogen.
end note

namespace entities #F2F2F2 {
        class section #F7E5FF {
                +{field} blocks std::list<block>
        }

        class document #F7E5FF {
                +{field} affiliated_keywords std::list<affiliated_keyword>
                +{field} drawers std::list<drawer>
                +{field} section section
                +{field} headlines std::list<headline>
        }
<snip>
```

You can process it with PlantUML, to produce SVG output (or PNG, etc):

```
$ plantuml dogen.org.plantuml -tsvg
```

The SVG output is particularly nice because you can zoom in and out as required. It is also rendered very quickly by the browser, as attested by Figure 5.

![SVG dogen.org](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MASD-Project/dogen/master/projects/dogen.org/modeling/dogen.org.svg)
_Figure 5: ```dogen.org``` SVG representation, produced by PlantUML._

While it was fairly straightforward to add _basic_ PlantUML support, the diagrams are still quite far from the nice orderly representations we used to have with Dia. They are definitely an improvement on not having any visual representation at all, mind you, but of course given our OCD nature, we feel compeled to try to get them as close as possible to what we had before. In order to do so we will have to do some re-engineering of the codec model and bring in some of the information that lives in the logical model. In particular:

- generalisation parsing so that we can depict these relationships in the diagram; this is actually quite tricky because some of the information may live on profiles.
- some level of resolution: all intra-model types must be resolved in order to support associations.

These changes will have to remain on the work stack for the future. For now the diagrams are sufficient to get us going, as Figures 5 and 6 demonstrate. Finally, its also worthwhile pointing out that PlantUML has [great integration with Emacs](https://github.com/skuro/plantuml-mode) and with org-mode in particular, so in the future it is entirely possible we could "inject" a graphical representation of model elements into the model itself. Clearly, there are many possibilities to explore here, but for now these remain firmly archived in the "future directions" section of the product backlog.

### Add support for reference directories

With this release we also managed to add another feature which we have been pinning for: the ability to have models in multiple directories. A new command line parameter was added: ```--reference-directory```.

```
[marco@lovelace dia]$ /work/DomainDrivenConsulting/masd/dogen/integration/build/output/clang11/Release/stage/bin/dogen.cli generate --help
Dogen is a Model Driven Engineering tool that processes models encoded in supported codecs.
Dogen is created by the MASD project.
Displaying options specific to the generate command.
For global options, type --help.

Generation:
  -t [ --target ] arg              Model to generate code for, in any of the
                                   supported formats.
  -o [ --output-directory ] arg    Output directory for the generated code.
                                   Defaults to the current working directory.
  -r [ --reference-directory ] arg One or more directories to check for
                                   referenced models.
[marco@lovelace dia]$
```

Users can supply directories containing their models and Dogen will check those directories when resolving references. This means you no longer need to keep all your models in a big jumble on the same directory, but should instead start to keep them together with the code they generate. We used this feature in Dogen to separate the old ```dogen.models``` directory, and created a number of ```modeling``` directories where all the content related to modeling for a given component will be placed. For example, see the ```dogen.org``` [modeling directory](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/tree/master/projects/dogen.org/modeling):

```
$ ls -l
total 76
-rw-r--r--   1 marco          marco     3527 2021-01-02 12:37 CMakeLists.txt

```

## Significant Internal Stories

This sprint had two key goals, both of which were achieved: org-mode and PlantUML support. These were described in the user facing stories above. In this section we shall provide more details about how this work was organised, as well as other stories which were not user facing.

### Org-mode work

The following stories were required to bring about org-mode support:

- **Add support for reading org mode documents**: creation of an org-mode parser, as well as a model to represent the types of this domain.
- **Add org-mode codec for input**: story to plug in the new org-mode parser into the codec framework, from an input perspective.
- **Create a model to org transform**: output side of the work; the addition of a transform which takes a Dogen model and generates an org-mode document.
- **Add tags to org model**: originally we tried to infer the element's meta-type by its position (e.g. package, "regular" element, attribute). However, it soon became obvious this was not possible and we ended up having to add org tags to perform this work. A story related to this one was also **Assorted improvements to org model**, where we sorted out a small number of papercuts with the org documents.
- **Consider replacing properties drawer with tables**: an attempt to use org-mode tables instead of property drawers to represent meta-data. We had to cancel the effort as we could not get it to work before the end of the sprint.
- **Convert library models into org**: we spent a fair bit of time in converting all of the JSON models we had on our library into org-mode. The automatic conversion worked fairly well, but it was missing some key bits which had to be added manually.
-  **Convert reference models into org**: similarly to the library models, we had to convert all of Dogen's models into org-mode. This also includes the work for [C++](https://github.com/MASD-Project/cpp_ref_impl/tree/master/projects/cpp_ref_impl.models/org) and [C#](https://github.com/MASD-Project/csharp_ref_impl/tree/master/Src/CSharpRefImpl.Models/org) reference models. We managed to use the automatic conversion for all of these, after a fair bit of work on the conversion code.
- **Create a "frozen" project**: although we were moving away from Dia, we did not want the existing support to degrade. The Dia Dogen models are an exacting test in code generation, which add a lot of value. There has always been an assumption that these would be a significant part of the code generator testing suite, but what we did not anticipate is that we'd move away from using a "core" codec such as Dia. So in order not to lose all of the testing infrastructure we decided to create a ["frozen" version of Dogen](https://github.com/MASD-Project/frozen), which in truth is not completely frozen, but contains a faithful representation across all supported codecs of the Dogen models at that point in time. With Frozen we can guarantee that the JSON and Dia support will not be any worse for all the features used by Dogen at the time the snapshot was taken.
- **Remove JSON and Dia models for Dogen**: once Frozen was put in place, we decommissioned all of the existing Dia and JSON models within Dogen. This caused a number of breaks which had to be hunted down and fixed.
- **Add org-to-org tests** and **Analysis on org mode round-tripping**: we added a "special" type of round-tripping: the org-to-org conversion. This just means we can read an org-mode document and then regenerate it without introducing any differences. It may sound quite tautological, but it has its uses; for example, we can introduce new features to org documents by adding it to the output part of the transform chain and then regenerating all documents. This was useful several times this sprint. It will also be quite useful in the future, when we integrate with external tooling; we will be able to append data to user models without breaking any of the user content (hopefully).
- **Inject custom IDs into org documents**: we tried not to have an identifier in org-mode documents for each element, but this caused problems when recreating the topology of the document. We had to use our org-to-org transform to inject ```custom_id``` (the org-mode attribute [used for this purpose](https://writequit.org/articles/emacs-org-mode-generate-ids.html)), though some had to be injected manually.

### Whitespace handling

Whilst it was introduced in the context of the org-mode, the changes to the handling of whitespace are a veritable epic in its own right. The problem was that in the past we wanted to preserve whitespace as supplied by the user in the original codec model; however, if we did this for org-mode documents, we would end up with very strange looking documents. So instead we decided to trim leading and trailing whitespace for all commentary. It took a while to get it to work such that the generated code had no differences, but this approach now means the org-mode documents look vaguely sensible, as does the generated code. The following stories were involved in adding this feature:

- **Move documentation transform to codec model**: for some reason we had decided to place the documentation trimming transform in the logical model. This made things a lot more complicated. In this sprint we moved it into the codec model, which greatly simplified the transform.
**Stitch templates are consuming whitespace**: this was a bit of a wild-goose chase. We thought the templates were some how causing problems with the spacing, but in the end it was just to do with how we trim different assets. Some hackery was required to ensure text templates are correctly terminated with a new line.
- **Remove leading and trailing new lines from comments**: the bulk of the work where we trimmed all commentary.
- **Allow spaces in headlines for org mode documents**: to make org-mode documents more readable, we decided to allow the use of spaces in headlines. These get translated to underscores as part of the processing. It is possible to disable this translation via the not-particularly-well-named key ```masd.codec.preserve_original```. This was mainly required for types such as ```unsigned int``` and the like.

### PlantUML work

There were a couple of stories involved in adding this feature:

- **Add PlantUML markup language support**: the main story that added the new codec. We also added CMake targets to generate all models.
- **Add comments to PlantUML diagrams**: with this story we decided to add support for displaying comments in modeling elements. It is somewhat experimental, and its look and feel is not exactly ideal, but it does seem to add some value. More work on the cosmetics is required.

### Smaller stories

A number of smaller stories was also worked on:

- **Merge dia codec model into main codec model**: we finally got rid of the Dia "modelet" that we have been carrying around for a few sprints; all of its code has now been refactored and placed in the ```dogen.codec``` model, as it should be.
- **Split orchestration tests by model and codec**: our massive file containing all code generation tests was starting to cause problems, particularly with treemacs and lsp-mode in emacs. This story saw the monster file split into a number of small files, organised by codec and product.
- **Add missing provenance details to codec models**: whilst trobuleshooting an issue we noticed that the provenance details had not been populated correctly at the codec level. This story addresses this shortcoming and paves the way for GCC-style errors, which will allow users to be taken to the line in the org-document where the issue stems from.

### Video series of Dogen coding

This sprint we recorded some videos on the implementation of the org-mode codec, and the subsequent use of these models. The individual videos are listed on Table 2, with a short description. They are also available as a playlist, as per link below.

_Video 2: Playlist "MASD - Dogen Coding: Formatables Refactor"._

|Video | Description |
|---------|-----------------|
| [Part 1](https://youtu.be/xfJNJ_9uAGU) | In this part we provide context about the current task and start off by doing some preliminary work setting up the required infrastructure.|
| [Part 2](https://youtu.be/HueypBCfwIM) | In this video we review the work done to process org mode documents, and start coding the codec transform. However, we bump into a number of problems.|
| [Part 3](https://youtu.be/QE7P9s-8Xg0) | In this video we review the work done to get the org codec to generate files, and analyse the problems we're having at present, likely related to errors processing profiles.|
| [Part 4](https://youtu.be/I-PkSHkpwhI) | In this video we review the work done offline to implement the basic support for reading org-mode documents and start the work to write org mode documents using our org model.|
| [Part 6](https://youtu.be/ZfpqC9PuEog) | In this part we review the round-trip work made to support org mode, and refactor the tags used in org models. We also add support for org custom IDs.|
| [Part 7](https://youtu.be/6XDt7lV0k_k) | Addendum video where we demonstrate the use of the new org mode models in a more expansive manner.|
| [Part 8](https://youtu.be/6wqsbT-jG6Y) | In this second addendum we work on the org-to-org transform, solving a number of issues with whitespacing.|
| [Part 9](https://youtu.be/GvsI7IGk5sY) | In this video we try to explore moving away from properties to represent meta-data and using tables instead, but we run into a number of difficulties and end up spending most time fixing bugs related to element provenance.|

## Resourcing

As you can see from the lovely spread of colours of the pie chart, our story-keeping this sprint was much healthier than usual; the biggest story took 24.3% which is also a great sign of health. Our utilisation rate was also the highest since records began, at 70%, and a marked improvement over the measly 35% we clocked last sprint. To be fair, that is mainly an artefact of the holiday season more than anything else, but who are we to complain - one is always happy when the numbers are going in the right direction, regardless of root cause. On the less positive front, we spent around 16.2% on activities that were not related to our core mission - a sizable increase from the 11% last time round, with the main culprit being the 4.5% spent on addressing Emacs issues (including some [low-level elisp investigations](https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs/issues/752)). On the plus side, we did make a few nice changes to our Emacs setup, which will help with productivity, so its not just sunk costs. Predictably, the _circa_ 84% dedicated to "real work" was dominated by org-mode stories (~54%), with PlantUML coming in at a distant second (7%). All and all, it was a model sprint - if you pardon the pun - from a resourcing perspective.

## Roadmap

The road map has been working like clockwork for the last few sprints, with us ticking stories off as if it was a mere list - clearly no longer the Oracle of Delphi it once was - and this sprint was no exception. Were we to be able to continue with the same release cadence, the next sprint would no doubt also tick off the next story on our list. Alas, we have ran out of coding time, so Sprint 31 will instead be very long running sprint, with very low utilisation rate. In addition, we won't bother creating sprints when the work is completely dedicated to writing; instead, regular service will resume once the writing comes to an end.

# Binaries

You can download binaries from either [Bintray](https://bintray.com/masd-project/main/dogen/1.0.30) or [GitHub](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/releases/tag/v1.0.30), as per Table 3. All binaries are 64-bit. For all other architectures and/or operative systems, you will need to build Dogen from source. Source downloads are available in [zip](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/archive/v1.0.30.zip) or [tar.gz](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/archive/v1.0.30.tar.gz) format.

_Table 3: Binary packages for Dogen._

**Note 1:** The Linux binaries are not stripped at present and so are larger than they should be. We have [an outstanding story](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/product_backlog.org#linux-and-osx-binaries-are-not-stripped) to address this issue, but sadly CMake does not make this a trivial undertaking.

**Note 2:** Due to issues with Travis CI, we did not manage to get OSX to build, so and we could not produce a final build for this sprint. The situation with Travis CI is rather uncertain at present so we may remove support for OSX builds altogether next sprint.

# Next Sprint

The goals for the next sprint are:

- to implement path and dependencies via PMM.

That's all for this release. Happy Modeling!

[![Documentation](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/blob/master/assets/doxygen_badge.svg)]
#+end_src

- add SVG of models to the docs.

At present we are not running the tests in github actions.

Notes:

  setting up of the VCPKG caching.

At present we are still relying on the old vcpkg setup, with downloads from
dropbox etc. We need to move to the new world of presets.

Notes:

- update the compiler versions (e.g. =clang9-Linux-x86_64-Debug=, etc).

*** Create clang build using libc++                                   :story:

At present we cannot build using clang and libc++. The main issue seems to be
that dogen code is using libc++ whereas the vcpkg dependencies are using the GCC
standard library. For now we defaulted to GCC's library but the right fix is to
use libc++.

*** Reference implementation build is borked                          :story:

We need to upgrade the ODB version of the reference implementation. Annoyingly
this will mean hitting the usual issues with vcpkg. We should probably consider
deprecating ODB from the reference implementation as well, or at least disabling
the building of the generated ODB code.

We have not used it since it was implemented a long time ago. In
addition, it is not very practical because it requires us to manually
generate the benchmark numbers and we never remember to do it. We
should just remove it and create a new benchmark framework based on
existing libraries and integrated with nightlies. Ideally it should
also output results to relational so that we can plot the evolution
over time.

*** Consider standardising all templates as mustache templates        :story:
    :LOGBOOK:
    CLOCK: [2022-03-20 Sun 09:18]--[2022-03-20 Sun 09:39] =>  0:21
    :END:

At present we have a somewhat complex story with regards to templating:

1. we use a mustache-like approach called wale, built in-house. It is used for
   some header files such as the M2T transforms.
2. we use a t4-like approach called stitch, also in-house. It is used for the
   implementation of the M2T transforms.

What would be really nice is if we could use the same approach for both, and if
that approach was not part of Dogen. The purpose of this story is to explore the
possibility of replacing both with a standard implementation of mustache,
ideally available on vcpkg. We already have a story for replacing wale with
mustache in the backlog, so see that for the choice of implementation. This
story concerns itself mainly with the second item in the above list; that is,
can we replace stitch with mustache.

In order to answer this question we first must try to figure out what the
differences between T4 and mustache are. T4 is a "generator generator". That is,
the text template generates C# code that generates the ultimate target of the
template. This means it is possible to embed any logic within the T4 template as
required, to do complex processing. It also means the processing is "fast"
because we generate C# code rather than try to introspect at run time. Stitch
uses the same approach. However, after many years of using both T4 and Stitch,
the general conclusion has been that the templates should be kept as simple as
possible. The main reason is that "debugging" through the templates is
non-trivial, even though it is simple C++ code (in the case of stitch).

Mustache on the other hand puts forward an approach of logic-less templates.
That is, the templates are evaluated dynamically by the templating engine, and
the engine only allows for a very limited number of constructs. In some
implementations, the so called "template hash", that is the input to the
template, is a JSON object. All the template can do is refer to entries in the
JSON object and replace tokens with the values of those entries.

Until recently we deemed mustache to be too simple for our needs because Dogen
templates were very complex. However, several things have changed:

- we do not want the templates to have any indentation at all; this should be
  left to clang-format as a subsequent T2T transform. This removes a lot of
  functionality we had in Stitch.
- we do not want the logical model objects to be processed any further in the
  template. As explained above this leads to a lot of complications. We want the
  object to be in its final form.
- we want all relationships etc to be encoded in the logical model object prior
  to M2T transformation.

In other words, we have slowly been converging towards logic-less templates,
though we are not yet there. The main stumbling blocks are:

- epilogue and prologue are at present handled by assistants:

#+begin_src
    text::formatters::assistant ast(lps, e, a, true/*requires_header_guard*/);
    const auto& o(ast.as<logical::entities::structural::object>(e));

    {
        auto sbf(ast.make_scoped_boilerplate_formatter(o));
        {
            const auto ns(ast.make_namespaces(o.name()));
            auto snf(ast.make_scoped_namespace_formatter(ns));
#>

class <#= o.name().simple() #>;

<#+
        } // snf
#>

<#+
    } // sbf

#+end_src

   Ideally we should just have a way to ask for the values of these fields.
- we need to investigate all templates and see if a JSON representation of a
  logical model element is sufficient to capture all required information.
  However the best way to do this is to have an incremental approach: provide a
  mustache based M2T and then incrementally move each M2T at a time.

If we do move to mustache, there are lots of advantages:

- remove all of templating code.
- we could allow users to supply their own mustache templates in a model. We can
  even allow for the dynamic creation of PMM elements and then the association
  of those elements with templates. End users cannot of course extend the LMM,
  but even just extending the LMM gives them a lot of power.
- we could create a stand alone tool that allows users to play with templates.
  All they need is a dump of the JSON representation of the objects in their
  model (this could be an option in Dogen). Then the tool can take the template
  and the JSON and render it to =std::out=. This makes template development much
  easier. If we integrate it with Emacs, we could even have a view where we
  do: 1) JSON 2) template 3) output. Users can then change 1) and 2) and see the
  results in 3). We don't even have to extend emacs for this, we could just use
  the compilation command.

Notes:

- if we could create JSON schemas for the LMM, we could then allow users to
  create their own JSON representations. Not sure how useful this would be.
- we need JSON support in Dogen for this.
- we need to measure how much slower Dogen would be with this approach.
  Presumably mustache is a lot slower that Stitch.
- from this perspective, the PMM is fixed but the PM then becomes a dynamic
  entity. We can supply a PM model with Dogen but that is just Dogen's
  interpretation of the physical space; users could supply their own PM's as
  required. The PMs need to bind to the PMM: either the user supplies its own
  TS, part etc or it must bind (via meta-data) to existing parts, TS etc. We
  also need to support two styles of declaring PM entities: inline (e.g. nested)
  or outline (e.g. we want to bind a given facet, part etc to an already
  existing TS, etc).
- we could hash both the mustache template and the JSON object used as input,
  and save those two hashes in the generated file. If the hashes match, don't
  bother regenerating.

*** Replace Dia IDs with UUIDs                                        :story:

We still have lots of IDs in models from Dia:

We need to update these to use UUIDs.

*** Capitalise titles in models correctly                             :story:

We still have models with lower case titles:

Capitalise these correctly.

*** Tighter vcpkg integration                                         :story:

If the user requests, we should also generate a vcpkg project that is
a clone of vcpkg but builds all of the base dependencies and pushes
them to a known location (e.g. GCS). Then, the build steps should
first download from that known location and put it on the path. It
should be trivial to update the vcpkg clone, e.g.: user adds new vcpkg
dependency to the model; dogen updates the data file, user commits the
update, new vcpkg build is triggered and generates new vcpkg zip, with
a stamp. User updates model to point to the new stamp and pushes. Next
build will use new vcpkg libraries. Ideally vcpkg builds for all
supported platforms (this is requested in the product model).

*** Process org-mode image links                                      :story:

At present we have hard-coded doxygen notation for image links:

: \image html dogen.orchestration/modeling/dogen.orchestration.svg

Instead, we should use org-mode notation for these links:

: #+CAPTION: This is the caption for the next figure link (or table)
: #+NAME:   fig:SED-HR4049
: [[./img/a.jpg]]

These then need to be read out by the org-mode parser and converted internally
into doxygen links.

*** org-to-org transform creates mustache templates incorrectly       :story:

At present we determine the language for the block by looking at the name of the
property. If its called =content= we use =mustache=. However, if a user creates
a field called =content= this should not kick in. We should have a configuration
option at the model level that enables this "intelligent" behaviour, and enable
it only for the =dogen.text= model.

*** Enable relational model locally                                   :story:

At present we are not building locally the relational model. We need to ensure
we are not breaking this code.

*** Change file format of tracing dumps according to codec            :story:

At present we always dump the transform inputs and outputs as =.json=. However,
if the content is in org-mode format, it would make more sense to have a =.org=
extension. The transform doing the dump should override the extension.

*** Logical model still has a traits class                            :story:

These should all have been removed, but its still there:

: #include "dogen.logical/types/traits.hpp"

O*** Rename merger to model compiler or weaver                         :story:

What we call "merging" is really the job of the "model compiler". We
should rename these transforms accordingly. The model compiler weaves
the models together. We can just rename the merger to these
terms. Literature:

#+begin_quote
A model compiler takes a set of executable UML models and weaves them
together according to a /consistent set of rules/. This task involves
executing the mapping functions between the various source and target
models to produce a single all-encompassing metamodel [...] that
includes all the structure, behavior and logic --- everything --- in
the \marginpar{Weaving, model compilers} system. [...] Weaving the
models together at once addresses the problem of architectural
mismatch, a term coined by David Garlan to refer to components that do
not fit together without the addition of tubes and tubes of glue code,
the very problem MDA is intended to avoid! A model compiler imposes a
single architectural structure on the system as a whole.
#+end_quote

*** Limitations of the current org-mode approach                      :story:

At present we decided to implement org-mode support directly in Dogen,
which has some advantages:

- we can process org-mode documents without having Emacs - e.g. you
  can create documents in other editors and still benefit from
  Dogen support.

However, there are also problems:

- org-mode is very complex. We don't want to support only a partial
  subset of the format; we want users to create regular org-mode
  documents with all of the org-mode functionality and then have them
  exported into code. This means our parser has to be very clever.
- we want to be able to export the model to other formats such as HTML
  / PDF etc. This means the document may contain all sorts of weird
  and wonderful config for those formats which we do not care about.
- we want users to add sections for documentation purposes such as
  images, etc. These won't necessarily be used for Dogen.

All of this makes us think we may have taken the wrong approach. We
should instead support some well-defined intermediary format which can
be understood by Dogen unequivocally, and which has a "trivial"
parsing implementation, similar to Dia XML. Then:

- we can then create an org-mode exporter in elisp which uses the
  existing org-mode functionality to determine what should be
  converted and what should be ignored.
- with this we can be confident that the org-mode document is handled
  correctly.

There are downsides though:

- third-party editors will no longer be supported - they will require
  their own exporter code, and most do not support this.
- there are more steps to the process, which is particularly annoying
  when you have several models. You now need to ensure you have exported
  them all, else you may get strange errors.
- the format must support mapping to the original locations so that we
  can still support LSP with proper errors, etc.

*** Add minor mode in emacs that finds element location               :story:

It would be nice to be able to run a command in emacs that opens the
model element associated with the current file.

*** Allow setting colours and visibility on PlantUML relations        :story:

When we start to model all relations on diagrams, they will become
quite confusing. However, we could probably make things easier by
allowing users to decide what colour to add to a relation and also if
they should be visible or not. These can be supplied as meta-data.

From [[https://plantuml.com/class-diagram#8dfb3b05fc895d2b][PlantUML docs]]:

#+begin_quote
You can change the color or style of individual relation or arrows
using the inline following notation:

: #color;line.[bold|dashed|dotted];text:color
#+end_quote

#+begin_src plantuml :file my-diagram.png
@startuml
class foo
foo --> bar : normal
foo --> bar1 #line:red;line.bold;text:red  : red bold
foo --> bar2 #green;line.dashed;text:green : green dashed
foo --> bar3 #blue;line.dotted;text:blue   : blue dotted
@enduml
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:my-diagram.png]]

Notes:

- we need to have an additional property to model the comments on the
  link, supplied by meta-data.
- we could also have different colours for each comment type:
  - source comments.
  - user comments for diagram only (not supported yet).

*** Add support for "diagram-only" comments                           :story:

We may want to add documentation for the purposes of the model that we
do not want expressed in code. It would be nice to be able to mark
some comments as "diagram-only".

*** Parse org-mode syntax in comment                                  :story:

At present we are expecting users to use doxygen mark up in the
model. This is not ideal:

- if we generate say C++ and C# the markup is invalid in one.
- if we generate HTML/PDFs the markup looks weird.

We should expect documents to have org markup only and then interpret
it in the generation. We probably only need a few items:

- lists
- =code variables=
- /italics/ and _underscores_

*** Simplistic renaming based on GUIDs                                :story:

One really simple way of renaming classes would be to have the UUID in
the comments (ideally the boilerplate) of each file. We could then
have a pre-generation step that reads in all the files and maps them
to an ID. Then, if a file is handcrafted, we could use the contents
instead of creating a blank file.

Notes:

- we could possibly also do some minor hackery such as search /
  replace the old namespace with the new namespace, and the old class
  name with the new class name though that would be much more
  dangerous. On the plus side, git would likely detect the rename
  which would mean we could then diff.
- we could possibly also issue the git rename commands for the
  affected files.
- note that generated files would not be part of this simplistic
  renaming.
- most of the work could be carried out in the physical model.
- one assumption here is that all handcrafted files are originally
  generated with their GUIDs and users must not delete them.
- this makes one wonder if we should not create a type of files that
  are "partially generated". That is, we could allow users freedom
  within some bounds but the "header" and "footer" of the file must
  always be generated by Dogen. This would guarantee the correct
  namespaces, header guards, etc. Perhaps we could make this an
  option:

  - fully generated
  - header and footer generation
  - skeleton generation as a one-off.

*** Generation statistics                                             :story:

It would be very useful to know percentages of generated code versus
hand-crafted code. We already have a report which groups files, we can
add to that report.

*** Remove commas from PlantUML enums                                 :story:

We don't need to add commas to separate PlantUML enums.

*** Fix PlantUML namespace comments                                   :story:

At present the comments appear as a link to the namespace. We should
try to do whatever it is we did for the model comment, which looks
like a regular note at the top of the namespace.

In addition, sub-namespaces seem to generate both a class with the
comment as well as the namespace itself (see text model).

*** Create a local resolver in codec to support PlantUML use case     :story:

We can create most of the links in PlantUML via local resolution. We
could create a local resolver, which only looks at types for the
current model. It lives inside of codec. For those types, if it
resolves, we can create the PlantUML link. In addition, we could also
resolve operations in the same way (once they have been
modeled).

Ideally, we should implement this resolve in such a way that it can be
used for merged models and stand alone models. We created a story on
the new approach for the resolver; we need to have a look at that and
see if it can be implemented as part of this work. For example, we
could flatten all names prior to calling resolver; use a GUID against
each type, read from custom ID in org mode.

The resolver needs to be primed with all of the existing model names
and namespaces, without depending on the qualified names data
structure. It should have its own data structures. It could live in
=identification=. The output of the resolver should be the GUID of the
type the name points to, or nothing if it could not resolve.

In the calling models, we need a transform that decomposes a type into
the names it references. Then, for each name, we call the resolver.

Notes:

- we could also create two step resolution. We could resolve all local
  names first, and mark them as resolved (for example by adding the
  UUID of the resolved type to the name) and leaving unresolved types
  unmarked. Then, the second merged model resolution would only
  resolve types which are not yet resolved. This would probably speed
  things up because we may end up with smaller containers.

*** Generate PNGs for PlantUML models                                 :story:

At present we are generating SVGs for the Plant UML models. This is
not ideal because emacs does not process them very well. Also, we are
checking in the SVG. We probably don't need to do that, nor do we need
to check in the Plant UML source, but it does offer an easy way to
check for regressions. At any rate, we should just have a CMake target
that creates the PNGs in the build output directory, and open those in
emacs with tabs and scroll bars.

*** Fix PlantUML indentation                                          :story:

At present if we indent a diagram in emacs we get a different
indentation compared to the generated one. We need to either get emacs
to indent correctly, or copy the emacs indentation. The main problem
at present is that we are indenting classes correctly in generated
code:

#+begin_src plantuml
namespace entities #F2F2F2 {
    class section #F7E5FF {
        +{field} blocks std::list<block>
    }
}
#+end_src

Whereas emacs does not:

#+begin_src plantuml
@startuml

namespace entities #F2F2F2 {
    class section #F7E5FF {
        +{field} blocks std::list<block>
    }
}
@enduml
#+end_src

Note that the behaviour seems different in org-babel. Note also that
notes have incorrect indentation (text model, inside a namespace):

#+begin_src plantuml
note top of  transformation_error
An error occurred whilst applying a transformation.
end note
#+end_src

Note also the extra space before exception name, as well as the
missing indentation inside the note.

Actually what is causing the problem with emacs indentation is the use
of top-level notes:

#+begin_src plantuml
note as N1
Contains all of the M2T transforms for all supported backends.
end note
#+end_src

We need to investigate why this causes indentation problems. Seems
like its valid syntax.

Note also that all comments are not indented correctly.

*** Consider creating a "top-level" group in PlantUML                 :story:

There are a number of classes that always show up at the top:

- registrar
- cmakelists
- main
- etc

These could also be part of a top-level group.

We could also have a group for logic-less templates if they are at the
top-level.

*** Consider adding operations for PlantUML                           :story:

We don't need full operation support for it to be useful. We could
have minimal support and use it to update the UML diagrams. It would
then later on be extended for merging code generation.

*** Empty classes do not need brackets in PlantUML                    :story:

At present we are still adding start and end brackets to empty classes:

#+begin_src plantuml
class string_to_document_transform <<dogen::handcrafted::typeable>> #FFFACD {
}
#+end_src

This takes space for no reason. We could just not print those brackets.

*** Consider creating a product PlantUML diagram                      :story:

Once we have support for product models, we should be able to create a
composite Plant UML diagram of the entire product, with linkages for
all types within the product. This means we should keep this use case
in mind when we resolve the problems we currently have with
associations intra-model.

*** Partial information extraction from logical model                 :story:

Since we just need generalisation and association information, we
could probably create a specialised chain in the logical model that
gives us the bare minimum to populate the relevant properties; we can
then extract those and map them to the codec ID. We should also make
the codec ID mandatory and use a map for the codec elements. The
orchestration model is responsible for stitching the information.

*** org-model and links to references                                 :story:

At present we are adding links as part of the drawers in
org-models. However, this is not ideal. We want to use regular
org-mode constructs. There are several use cases for links:

- we want org-mode links so that we can make use of tools such as
  org-roam.
- we need to use the links for dogen to resolve the model. Both of
  these use cases happen whilst the code is in its normal shape in the
  git repository.
- when we generate doxygen documentation we need links that can work
  when the site has been published. At this point the models have all
  been copied to a different location by doxygen.

We need to find out a way to make links work for all of these use cases.

*** PlantUML and hyperlinks                                           :story:

Apparently it is possible to embed HTTP links in SVG diagrams. This
means it may also be possible to supply these as inputs in the
PlantUML model. If so, it would be nice to be able to find the model
definition of an element by clicking on the element. Its not clear if
this would work in the SVG support we have in Emacs.

*** Type that references itself results in a recursive include        :story:

In org-mode headline we seem to be including the headline itself:

: #include "dogen.org/types/entities/headline.hpp"

In the associations transform, we could do a quick check: if a type
references itself, the remove the association.

*** Use a Dogen drawer instead of properties                          :story:

Its possible users will want to add their own drawers to Dogen
documents. For example, maybe you want to clock against model items or
use org-brain. We need to preserve all of these entries when
roundtripping. The easiest way to achieve that is to try to separate
the Dogen information from the non-Dogen one. If we had our own
drawers it would be much easier, we could simply state that you are
not allowed to add any non-Dogen stuff there and copy across the Dogen
drawer into the original document.

We could keep the element ID as a =CUSTOM_ID= in the =PROPERTIES=
drawer though as that is a org concept.

*** Org Roundtripping is lossy at present                             :story:

One way to roundtrip documents without losing information is to
preserve the original org document, run the Dogen transforms (for
example to obtain the generalisation and association information),
transform that back into an org-model and then copy over the dogen
elements into the original org document by performing lookups based on
element ID. This way we ensure we do not lose any information of the
original model. The way we are roundtripping at present, if you add
any non-Dogen headlines, these would be dropped on the round trip.

In fact, its like we need a "merge algorithm" to merge the source
document with the roundtripped document.

*** Copy org documentation from rust implementations                  :story:

The rust module for org-mode seems very well documented. We should try
to copy across all applicable documentation.

*** Consider moving CI to GitHub Actions                              :story:

At present we are using Travis and AppVeyor for our CI. However, it
would be nice to have a single place with all of the CI (and even more
ideally, packaging as well). GitHub seems to offer some kind of CI
support via GitHub actions. However, we need to first move to building
on [[*Build dogen from docker][docker]].

Actually it seems we don't even need to do very much. See [[https://raymii.org/s/articles/Github_Actions_cpp_boost_cmake_speedup.html][this article]].

- [[https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib/tree/master/.github/workflows][quantlib GH]]: support for all operative systems (OSX, Win, Linux) as
  well as a number of interesting actions.

*** Consider adding support for "literate testing"                    :story:

It would be nice if we could create an org-mode file specifying a
test, then add the code as an orb-babel clock and then tangle the file
into a c++ file. Ideally the tangling should be done by Dogen (as well
as by org-mode).

Actually, we don't need a separate org-mode file, this is just the
class definition for the test fixture.

Links:

- [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref/blob/master/test/all-org-test.org][all-org-test.org]]: literate test from org-ref.

*** Documentation as the aggregate model view                         :story:

It would be really nice if we could "merge" different types of
documentation, all written using org-mode:

- user manual
- developer manual, which is the aggregation of the product model and
  all the component models.

These should create two separate PDFs. We should also be able to
create a dynamic site for the product by just pointing to the git
repository of the project.

*** Reporting with diffs                                              :story:

At present its possible to create a diff with dry run and diffing
enabled or to do a report showing all operations - which produces an
org-mode report. However, what would be nice, especially when testing
is to merge the two: create a report that also includes the diffs.
