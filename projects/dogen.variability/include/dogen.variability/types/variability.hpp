/**
 * @brief The varibility model is responsible for managing variation in MASD.
 *
 * One of the core principles of MASD is to enable the development of
 * "families" of software products; that is, sets of products which share
 * similar "traits". Those traits are encoded as "configuration" so that
 * we can talk about them at a higher level of abstraction. This approach
 * is often referred to in the literature as Software Product Line
 * Engineering (SPLE). MASD takes a very simplistic view of SPLE,
 * allowing a very restricted form of variation across a set of
 * well-defined features. The present model provides the basic
 * infrastructure required to define features, as well as to read those
 * features from dynamic data structures.
 *
 * Note that the present model only concerns itself with the low-level
 * implementation of variability. You can think of it as a stack, with
 * this model sitting at the bottom. Above it lie the logical
 * representation of variability, which enables the code generator to
 * generate code that makes use of the infrastructure provided by this
 * model. But the present model is designed to be understood in complete
 * isolation from the layers above (and in fact, precedes the generalised
 * approach).
 *
 * The variability space is indirectly connected to the physical dimension.
 * The main reason why is because we need to instantiate features across
 * the geometry of physical space (e.g. "for every facet...", "for every
 * archetype...", etc). However, we have tried to avoid coupling these two
 * models together because we do not think that conceptually this coupling
 * makes sense. That is, it just happens that we instantiate features across
 * the geometry of physical space, but this is not a concern o veriability -
 * only of its user. This decoupling was achieved by creating the concept
 * of template instantiation domains, which are just sets. These are mapped
 * elsewhere from the geometry of physical space.
