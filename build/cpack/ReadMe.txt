Dogen is a code generator designed to target domain models.

Dogen is the reference implementation of the MASD Project code generator. MASD -
Model Assisted Software Development - is a new methodology for the development
of software systems based on MDE. In lay terms, Dogen's objective is to automate
the development process as much as possible: the user creates models in one of
the supported frontend formats and respecting a set of predefined restrictions;
Dogen then uses this input to generate a source code representation of the
model.
